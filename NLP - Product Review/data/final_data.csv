galaxy,5,The Samsung Galaxy s9 is arguably the most beautiful phone ever created. Samsung Galaxy S line of phones are world famous for their design and build quality. Holding this phone in your hand is like picking up a device from the future. Battery life is excellent and Samsung's UI and operating system software is getting better with every update. Now that the s10 is out the s9 is getting cheaper.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"great  phone smart features easy to use ,, , plenty of gadgets.. good  phone  camera excellent ..easy to use..light weight..easy load apps..easy to use..easy to  read numbers.. nice colours..will allways stick with a samsung",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,I really liked the phone. It has good camera which is the best feature and it was a good change after using iphone for about a decade. Really recommend it.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"First of all the camera quality does not disappoint, as are all samsung cameras it is excellent on the S9. I have found the battery doesn't last very long, I have to charge my phone every night, the button below the volume keys for Bixby is a tad annoying or just may take longer to get used to. Overall I have found the s9 To be just as good as my s7 Edge and my rather cheap OPPO.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"As a flagship phone goes, everything is pretty standard. Speed is fast, touch is sensitive, interface is intuitive.I take a lot of photos and while there is no ""portrait mode"", the ""selective focus"" does a good job of creating the bokeh effect. Where the S9 really stands out is the low light photography. I can take sharp photos with accurate white balance in dimly lit restaurants using the auto settings (attached photo taken at night and in the rain). The biggest downside is that even on a normal workday where I don't make extensive use of my phone, the battery only lasts one day on optimised mode.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,"Had Samsung S9 for just over 1 month, battery life barely last 2 days on medium power saving. My Samsung S7 edge had better battery life, I have had an iPhone 7 (work phone) for 18 months, use all day during working hours last at least 3 days. How could you go so wrong samsung. Not happy",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"The camera quality is very good with this phone.  There is no need to buy a separate camera.  The phone is easy to use, apps easily install and I have not had an issue at all with this type of phone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,Fantastic phone. The camera is great and the screen is gorgeous to look at. Samsung software is easy to use but at times feels like there is too much on that is not needed and makes the phone slower.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Camera quality is decent, occasionally plays up however most the time works well. Display is fantastic am yet to have a problem with it. Apps and games run smoothly and the built in cache cleaner app is fantastic.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"My New Samsung S9 is my go to girl . I simply could not get through and juggle life without it . From taking photos and capturing memories to appointments for the kids , makes my life easier",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"Was told the phone is amazing...The camera never focuses, even when using the selective focus setting, it takes the photo but always says could not focus..The battery life is terrible, my husband gets nearly two days from his phone, i get a day if that, i have only been up a hour took it of charge and it is now down to 78% and i havent watched anything just been googling reviews on this phone, and all open apps are closed,Dont like how the screen goes around the sides so brought a phone cover,I wish I stayed with what I had but ohh well",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,The camera is amazing on this phone and the close ups are like looking through a microscope. I cannot fault the camera. I do not like the curved screen and find the edge of the screen too easy to accidentally touch and then start other apps. The finger print scanner is not easy to use on the back and I like it on the front better like with the S7. The sounds are good. I can no longer put a different ring tone on for each contact which seems like a step backwards.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,1,Samsung is crap and cheap phone. I wonder whose stupid idiot made these phone. Always had so many problems whenever I use this crap phone. iPhones are much better and their customer service is best also not like crap Samsung!!!!!,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,Excellent for now - If it starts to degrade like my last Android phone I will update my review to suite.Pros:- The camera is awesome.- I like the different methods of unlocking the phone- It is currently quick and runs smoothly but then so did my Nexus 5 when it was new.- It has fantastic battery life. I spent a good couple of hours the other day watching movies on netflix and realised that I hadn't plugged my phone in. It was only- Transferring my data was made really simple by downloading the Samsung app to do it.- Bizarrely in Jan 19 the 256GB version was cheaper than the 64GB version! Not sure what was going on there but check before you buy!Cons:- The curved screen is a bit of a gimmick. I am so blinking worried that I am going to smash it for the first time ever I have put a protective cover on my phone.- The retina scan makes my eye ache if I use it in a dark room. I have disabled that feature.- Samsung get a bit snotty if you try to switch out their phone dialer and SMS app.- The Samsung keyboard interface is not as good as the stock Google one (There is probably a way to switch).,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"I like this phone.Pros:1. Screen resolution2. Nice camera3. Easy to access apps and other thingsCons:1. When you hold the phone the hand touches the screen, sometimes apps started2. Unhappy with the battery life.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,I'm so happy with the camera on this phone compared to my old apple phone. The processing speed and loading apps is also so much faster. Also so much easier to load photos on and off phone compared to apple. I still love apple TV and wish samsung did a similar thing but I got this phone for a better camera and bigger storage and am absolutely impressed with both.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"MESSAGING AND CALLS. - Very easy to call and to message people. Great controls and a great look. You can even put some contacts on your home screen to all them easily and set some numbers up on speed dial.CAMERA QUALITY - Absolutely amazing. I have a good Canon camera & ""some"" photos I take with my phone, people think I took them with my camera & they become amazed when I tell them, that it's actually my phone. Love using the focus mode and it blurs out the back ground beautifully. Night mode is great when using flash .BATTERY LIFE - Battery has been working fantastic for me!",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,Screen goes all the way to the edge. I don't like that. I kept pressing things by accident. Phone is way to slippery so had to spend 30 dollars on a cover. Bixby is a joke. Should have stuck with the s7. I loved that phone. Wonder if I can find another.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"Phone is generally good. However, touch screen stopped working only a few months after I bought it, and tech support were not very helpful. Was able to backup and keep files and sent away for a replacement through Optus. Not really a fan of the curved edges, feels like it makes it more prone to damage if there isn't a case.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,Always liked samsungs reliabilty.Though this camera has improved on this model. For me personally its teenybopper gadgets and magic makeup and photoshop selfies & gifs etc make me thinking of ditching it for less hype item sometimes when i accidentally bump something. But most phones are full of the same junk these days. I have a cover on mine so i am actually annoyed the flash doesn't work well because it bounces off edge of coverframe.I chose purple model but with cover noone sees it anyway.  I find it too big and awkward to use easily. I liked the older galaxys with menu 'button' instead of annoying screen pressing everything. And preferred the older shape balance for holding & ease of use especially with camera etc.Overall I dont love it. But i dont hate it either.its reliable quality to me. The ability to night time photograph & the storing of 8000 photos recently helped me realise an upside to it ;)I havent had any issues with it.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Camera is Good if not best available at the moment. Display quality is really good.Apps are really responsive and loved Finger scanner on back side , it's so responsive than my previous S6.So far Best Android Mobile i have Ever used, Battery is reasonable. Loved Dolby Atmos sound in this mobile it really sounds great.Good for Games , great Mobile if you are Android Lover.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,I updated my old Samsung Galaxy s5 for the s9 and so far I am very happy with it. I am only having to charge it every second day which is much better then the daily charging I was needing on my old mobile. The features are easy enough to use and I really like the rose gold coloured.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,1,"My phone was protected with a case and screen protector. Only 3 weeks old my phone was sadly dropped at hip height and I'm no BFG but smash! With almost tears in my eyes as I did everything to protect it and it still smashed I went to the repair shop! Here the tears let go! I was told  by the repairman that the screen protectors dont work well due to curved edges and it will cost me $490 to fix. What the actual fries! NOTHING to do with the repair shops, Price set by samsung! Keep this in mind when purchasing this brand! I am now the owner of a (not a one of a kind at that price )cracked S9!",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Samsung is years ahead of Apple smartphones and is the leading smartphone for technology. I've always been an Apple user, since I switched to Samsung I would never switch back! The camera leaves all other smartphone cameras in the past. Battery lasts all day long and it even come with a stylist!! Boasts the best software and charges wirelessly",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Camera is great in all conditions, however, natural sunlight is the best lighting. The brightness of the display is outstanding. I will comment that I hate how it takes like 10 seconds to change the power saving mode, and the phone lags out hard in these 10 seconds. I use my phone to take pictures, play games, and watch youtube. Almost all apps run smoothly on my phone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,I love the phone compared to an iPhone I definatly will keep buying samsung in the future it's so easy to use I've got a good uag case. its been dropped a few times but Hasnt broken yet I also have a cignett glass screen protector. They cost $60 and the case was about $50 from memory so its a lot to outlay in 1 go when you include norton ontop but I am glad I upgraded because I cant fault the phone at all. Love the curved glass screen and with double the warranty than an iPhone I just couldnt say no and I'd highly recommend the samsung s9,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Runs smooth very nice features, does still heat up on under load or on charge, camera is very clear at night.Love the due bluetooth feature.Wish the lcd was higher quality.Does lag when to many apps are open id say after 5 to 6 apps. Battery life is excellent.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Bought this for my husband as he is an Android user.  Decent size screen, camera takes a really clear shot.  Much better than the Samsung 7 model which he upgraded from.  Got the blue back on it which looks really good. No issues so far... Purchased protective casing also.  Good Phone",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"I am going to start this review off by saying I absolutely love this phone, however it does have a few small compromises (but they're by no means deal breakers).I bought this phone in October after owning iPhones for some time, and am happy with the experience so far. The screen is excellent (as has always been the case with Samsung phones), the app selection rivals what is found on iOS and it has IP68 water resistance which is handy if I get caught in the rain on my commute home from work.I was surprised to discover that the Galaxy S9 has a slightly weaker battery than my iPhone X; however this could be remedied by purchasing the Galaxy S9+ or the Note 9 (which is similar to the S9 with a few extra features) which has a larger battery. I often find myself giving the phone a quick top up before I head out for the evening as the battery doesn't usually make it past 6pm. This is mostly painless though as Samsung includes a fast charger in the box (unlike Apple where you have to buy a fast charger separately).The other small issue I have with this phone is how long Samsung takes to release software updates. For example, the S9 is still running Android 8 Oreo even though Android Pie has been out for some months. This has always been an issue with Samsung and will hopefully be fixed with Project Treble (an attempt by Google to push software updates to more phones quicker). I would've liked to see pure Android on this flagship instead of a skinned version.Like I said at the beginning of this review, the things I have mentioned above are not deal breakers, and would certainly not stop me from recommending this phone to anyone.What I like:The camera- pictures are always sharp and detailed, just like they were on my old iPhone XSoftware (kind of)- Samsung has really cleaned up their Android skin over the past yearUSB C- Everything is beginning to adopt USB C which means carrying around fewer cablesWireless charging- very convenient, especially when it's darkIP68 water resistance- Handy when I get caught in the rain on my commute homePowerful CPU and plenty of RAM- If it wasn't for uni, I could potentially get away with using this as my primary computing deviceSomething else worth mentioning is how Samsung bundled a free pair of JBL noise cancelling headphones, worth nearly $400 with the phone- a worthy extra.Overall, I have no hesitation in recommending this phone to those who want the best of all worlds. However if you're a heavy user (someone who uses their phone for 12+ hours per day), I'd recommend the S9+ or the Note 9 as they both have larger batteries.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"This has been a great phone, the camera is great. Brightness is great, even in bright sun when it's oftentimes difficult to see the screen on other devices. Great memory storage, even for a smaller memory phone, I have hundreds of games, photos, music and apps with still plenty of storage. Never had a problem with apps freezing and glitching. All around great with functions and durability, lightweight and a bonus of coming in a pretty Lilac color!",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,Everything all good. Perfect smart phone I ever have had. Good rare camera. Easy to use. I just love it.  I have been using it from more than 6 month after I lost my iphone and I have not got anything to complain yet. Would really recommend all to use it.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Everything about this phone is awesome. I've got the plus version. High quality screen with a great screen size. The only problem is the price which I think is a bit high. Otherwise there is no problem with the phone. Fantastic battery life, good speed and very high quality photos.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"People have been amazed at the quality of the camera, wondering if I used a mobile phone or a more serious camera. The slo-mo function is also excellent, allowing for some really fun videos of the kids jumping into the pool, fighting with foam swords etc. The form factor is good - a bit screen but not too big to fit in your hands. The dedicated Bixby button is slightly annoying at first, and I haven't used the Bixby function, but you can turn it off so it's not really an issue. The fingerprint scanner is sensibly located on the back of the phone. Overall it's a great phone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Love the displayLove the feelLove the runLove the battery timeI've had a Samsung galaxy for the past 6 years... so not much has changed in the standard.Still trying to work out all the camera features. Everyone tells me it can take a great photo.... probably user error... but my photo's are still looking pretty basic compared to what my friend is taking on her iphone. So I guess I need to google and work out how to use the pro feature? My one wish is that it would just take a super high res, high colour photo without me having to do the work?",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"I have been using the S9 now for a few months.  Overall great experience.  Mobile internet, SMS, and calls - all are seamlessly working.  Even if on the phone for a long call, it does not get too warm.  Battery life is also good. Phone camera is also improved.  It could improve on the quality of the earphones but overall its a great day to day phone to use.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Love my new Samsung phone! The battery lasts for the whole day. The display is also bright and easy to adjust. I am satisfied with the phone features for the camera. There are selfie option, slow motion and plenty of others.The only downside would be the infinite screen, because sometimes it makes it difficult to put screen saver.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,The camera on this phone is phenomenal. Clear pictures even in low light. Streams movies easily and responds really well. Apps run smoothly on this model and I have had no issues as yet. Love the fingerprint capability on the back of the phone. Don't really like Bixby and it was difficult to get used to the extra button on the left hand side.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Everything runs smoothly, travelling around in a caravan so need the blue tick it has to get more phone signals.  Very quick loading apps, easy to use.  Camera is amazing with lots of options for photos and very easy for me so a grandmother to download photos of new grandsons",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"I've owned Samsung Galaxy phones since the S4. There's a reason why they are the most popular, they are simply the best by performance and features in the smallest package.I'll keep buying these phones if they continue to make them this good.The only thing I don't like and it's the same with all smart phones is that the screens break so easily.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"S9 screen unconventional, double curved screen Yan value, different light colors. The high-pass 845 CPU is very smooth and the program is open to run quickly. 12 million variable aperture dual camera, 1.5 large aperture, night vision illusion the effect is also very good. The shooting worked well. The screen resolution is high, the color is rich, the display effect is good. The battery is enough to charge once a day. The downside is that some apps are temporarily not equipped for Android 8.0, turn on the flash, part of the optimization is not enough, the phone is sometimes hot and hot, such as when charging music. Summary: Samsung S9 looks very nice, well-equipped, very good product.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,1,"Never been more upset with a phone before coming from using an iPhone after 6 years to this. Battery is horrible, phone dials people itself, screen sometimes plays up, way too expensive to fix and Samsung don't help In any way. Have had it for nearly 2 months now and screen decides to freeze and go yellow on its own.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Originally in the use of the note series, s9+ most attracted me is Bixby, really can use the voice of the assistant, a long and narrow shape, good grip, the photo is very wide, the screen display effect is gorgeous; fingerprint lock more than the old generation of machine sensitivity increased several times, arc screen touch than flat screen more mellow, CPU GPU performance has been very good for me.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Good performance, the basic battery to rush once a day, not very often play games, only watch news and chat. Standby state power consumption is a bit high, video chat more than 10 minutes the camera will be a bit hot. Playing games is easy, there is no non-smooth phenomenon. Facial iris recognition is sensitive. The camera night view effect is very good. Summary, battery good, other aspects perfect.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"This phone is So nice to look at. Its thin and curved. Fits in the hand well.I love that the phone is waterproof, I have washed it under the tap and have had not issues.The phone has excellent features for security and connections, you can login with face recognition or iris or both. You can also use finger prints.I love this phone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"This phone has a beautiful quality display. The flash with night photo mode is great. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly when being used, while I'm not using it it keeps the charge well. I always have it playing music to bluetooth headphones at night and approx 70% gets me through the night without having to leave it plugged into a charger.Apps and games run smoothly.The worst part of this phone is the curved screen and not being able to get a screen protector to STAY ON. I've had them put on by mobile phone 'kiosks' etc, tried different types, gel and glass and they all lift eventually and always have at least 1 bubble. I will not own another curved screen phone after this one.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,I hate BIXBY  and do not want to use it ...but it insists upon itself ...what a waste of a butyon grrrrrrr SO ANNOYING also taking screenshots id a pain in the butt ...hard to make work and invokes BIXBY WHICH I HATE.Lost so much functionality with camera to last model ...downgrade not upgrade ...no portrait functionality any more,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,1,"At first glance the s9 is beautiful. Then you turn the thing on and you get to know it more and it starts to do some silly things. I have never had an issue with Apple. It always run everything smooth and you get pretty much everything you backed up. My s9 keyboard started to type things on its own while I was typing so I took it in to the shop and they done a software reboot. I lost 4 months worth of photos of my family and other important files that I will never get back. Changing to Samsung is the worse thing I have ever done. I just recontracted so I can't do much to change my phone. But I will definitely go back to iPhone as soon as my 1 year is up. Samsung phones tries to do to much and everything crap itself. While iPhone is so user friendly, I don't know why people would ever go for Samsung. This idiot did it. Don't make the same mistake.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"Camera quality is good although i find it hard to be advertised as one of the major selling points of this phone, I would personally not buy this phone based on the Camera quality. Display is good and brightness settings (cant complain). My biggest complaint with this phone being one of the latest is that there is no IR meaning apps like tv remote do not work where as more affordable phones manage to have this feature. Also the phone boasts on being waterproof yet my speakers muffle at the slightest touch of water ...go figure.. this phone is far from living up to expectations.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Suddenly phone-less, I was shown the Galaxy S9 in Telstra shop and initially skeptical that it was similar in performance and features to a long-serving LG phone. I made a list of features, and they all got ticked off before yet more eye-catching features were added to the list...Things got better and better once I had a play with the real deal rather than a locked-up dummy! Extremely speedy, crisp operation, a true delight to hold and operate. As with so many other phones, a little slippery and slender so it requires (demands!) a secure grip, ably assisted by something like an Otterbox. Bought it immediately, no questions asked and haven't questioned the purchase at any time.  Built-in auto-on/off blue light filter for night use saves scouring the Google store for something presumably better. Self-adjusting display visibility makes it a dream to use in bright daylight as well as those pesky late night calls. When on fast-charge, it has a sleepy, dreamy, gradually alternating ""daydream"" colour pattern. Notifications are quite novel: a small tri-coloured LED on the front is assisted by a vibration and peculiar change of the display to a pale yellow -- takes some getting used to initially, but very effective at attracting attention (for better, for worse...). All apps run smoothly with no hang-ups at all.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"I recently upgraded my Samsung galaxy 5 to the Samsung galaxy 9 and there is definitely a noticeable difference in the operating system. The galaxy 9 has much more features, is much more user friendly. Has far superior security measures. Not to mention all the additional features it has to offer.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,I am happy with everything about the phone. Great latest technology with samsung. I have had lots of samsung ones and this is the best! The camera is super clear and captures great moments. I use lots of different apps on this phone. I love how you can see the time lit up even when you're not using the phone.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,I've had Samsung's ever since they first came out. From the s1 to s9. I wouldn't buy anything else. Only thing that puts me off is the expensive screen repairs if the screen cracks. Also the phone charge seems to die quickly even if you leave your phone all night on charge.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Camera is amazing it's a huge step up from my non exploding Note Edge. Good size, stable software, no complaints. Battery is average but will last 2 days if not used heavily. Wireless charging works well but note that it takes twice as long as plugging it in. yes it has a headphone jack, which is great.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"The Samsung Galaxy S9 is my fifth Galaxy after my S2, S4, S6 and S7.  It is simply the best solution for me.  As a camera it excels.  The S7 was nearly there but the front camera wasn’t quite what I wanted.  The S9 now does it all.  Perfect in low light, fabulous portraiture, sharper output than any camera lens I own and versatile for 95% of photography.  I use it for all product shots on eBay and it has made my life a lot easier.  As a portable computer it organizes my 7,000 database records with ease in the Contacts folder.  Battery life is excellent and wireless charging is spot on.  The audio input jack is a continuing bonus and this makes for a versatile audio recorder in all situations.  USB C connection is great.  Speakers are terrific, the screen is great for video playback.  The S9 is a powerhouse with intuitive, useful software that is quick to use in any situation.  Build quality and waterproofing are first rate.  The size is perfect for me which is why I chose it over the S9+.  It can nearly replace any other camera I use professionally but it can’t handle ultra wide interior photography.  It is missing the 3:2 format which is what I prefer, so I hang onto other cameras for this purpose.  But given that it is always on me, means there is the matter of convenience and confidence knowing that I can make do at a pinch.  Multi tasking means making a phone call, sending a text and dealing with email all at the same time.  Android software means it is an open system that is constantly being developed so I don’t feel I am being held hostage to proprietary software.  From a productivity point of view, it is a compliment to a powerful laptop and camera systems that lets me develop my imagination, express my creativity and do everything I want that was still impossible, as recently as two years ago.  There are cheaper alternatives starting to come out of China that are similar but for the time being I am sticking with Samsung Galaxy, as they have never let me down.  This factor alone never makes me wonder about the top price proposition that is being paid.  What is the point of saving money if what you buy can’t do what you want?  With an S9 I don’t have to wonder.  If I didn’t have it I would use my S7 because that was nearly as good.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"The camera is powerful at any time! Camera feature is the most prominent in this phone.I love the design and the display is just amazing.I got all apps can run smoothly so far.The price is quite expensive, so I think bundling price is much preferred for buying this phone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,I purchased my phone through our local Telstra shop. One of the features I was looking for in my new phone was a good quality camera. I have been more than impressed with the camera even more than I expected. The bigger screen shows quality images that I am more than happy with. In fact on a recent week long island holiday I used camera phone exclusively rather than my stand alone camera. I am more than happy with the brightness of the display. I also do use my phone to check E mails as well as a camera.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"In love with my new phone! I think its excellent that it comes with a back protective case to save the beautiful colour from being damaged by every day use. Love the ""edge"" it's a very snazzy look. The only negative so far is it only plays the first 30 seconds of each of the songs in my playlist,  however I suspect this can be easily resolved in settings somewhere, I just haven't worked it out yet. Thanks Samsung, you've delivered yet again!",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,"Omg I hate hate hate Bixbie, granted I don't know what it is or how it works except and a marketing device that gets in the way everytime I use the phone. I do not want advertising on my phone!!!!! I have managed to turn everything Bixbie off but it is so horrible I can't like my phone, it has tainted any enjoyment I could of had from having a new phone. I was an iPhone user and the similar but different operating system is annoying to get used to, the change in connecting cables from previous Samsungs is annoying too, Siri was not something I used but at least I could choose his voice for when I did use him and he didn't try to sell me anything. I get Bixbie is Samsung's Siri but it is a horrible version.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,"OK,  so it's a good phone.  But the battery sucks so bad I LITERALLY returned the brand new S9! I'm so surprised to. With all the updates and software on the device that to expect the battery to just run out so quickly and easily. It's a nightmare! I need a phone,  all day everyday and I'm used to using a phone all day everyday without recharging, not with the S9!",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Fantastic phone charges super fast ,battery last ages , take beautiful photos with lots of option ,slow motion is awsome.  Screen is vibrant and really clear if you like taking photos or videos this is the phone for you. The phone features are great and it has some really good widgets.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,Photo quality is absolutely amazingEasy to useBattery life is greatLoved my 7 but this just has that extra you wanted not neededStruggling with do I keep and jump up the new note?Either way loving my new phone the only negative I have was can you make sure a few phone covers are brought out when you release straight away as I wanted to protect phone straight away lol,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Great quality. Wished that the battery last longer.Small, thin, compact. Comes with a clear phone cover.Easy to transfer iPhone data to Samsung S9.Purchased the samsung gear S3 frontier.My husband talked me into changing to Samsung. Pretty happy.There is an option to add SD card for extra storage, which you can purchase from JB Hi Fi.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"Camera quality on S9 is just amzaing. I've been using it for the last six months now and happy with the overall performance too. A slightly disappointing thing is the battery life. Compare to other high end phones available in the market, I think S9 is far behind in this",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"This samsung Galaxy S9 has all the right stuff and is built very well,the camera works well in all kinds of light and the video runs at a slow motion speed if you want it to Great to have,it even comes with a cable so you can lift all your files off your old phone,this made life for me a lot easier and saved me a lot of time.I recommend this great phone to anyone thinking about buying one.I also bought the cordless charger dock station and that is also great,no need for cables anymore.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Recently upgraded from a Note 4 to the S9. I run my business almost entirely from my phone and had been very happy with the Note 4 until it began to have major hardware issues that could not be rectified. I was initially a little concerned about the shift down in screen size, as I had become so accustomed to the larger Note 4 screen, however the infinity display on the S9 has more than made up for this with almost the entire screen utilised. The phone is super fast and switches between apps seamlessly, as well as being capable of running many apps at once without slowing down. The sound quality is superb, I can play music directly from my phone and it is clear and harmonic. I have been equally impressed by the quality of the both the front facing and rear cameras, especially in low light conditions. My only dislike with the S9 is that the screen picks up fingerprints easily and I find I need to polish them away regularly or else the screen looks dirty. But this is only a minor cosmetic issue and doesn't affect the overall performance of the phone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,This is the nicest coloured mobile I've ever had. The display is an excellent size & picture quality. Bought a toughened glass screen cover so hopefully it will be extremely durable. I use my mobile to play lots of games so the 64GB is going to be fantastic. Everything seems to run as smoothly as all my past Samsung's although as it's brand new I'm still exploring it's many features.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,I loved my s8 then decided to upgrade to s9. Big regrets!! My smses to friends are delayed or end up grouped and recieved hours later! Very unreliable SMS service! The rest of the phone is great. Just not the SMS. I really regret the mobile now! I dont recommend it! My friend has same phone and he has same problems!,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,"Had phone for a total of 3 hours  and hate it .Any functions close to edge of screen you need to nearly press your finger through the glass to get to respond .Face , retina and fingerprint login have repeatedly failed so switched them off .Smart switch transfer only transferred some of my apps and corrupted some that did make it across  .Bluetooth recognition to car won't work .",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"This phone is reasonably easy to find my way around the settings. Similar to my old phone, which helped, but a couple of features l had to enlist my adult children to  help. The camera is absolutely terrific on the phone - so clear and so is the video footage. Google maps have had a big work out since moving to the city - and the messenger app is already in the phone - handy.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,1,"My laptop stays connected, my tablet does but this phone cant stay connected reliably for despite being the so called best android phone of 2018. Never going to buy another samsung product again. I guess the specs are good, it looks good but if a phone cant do something as basic as this properly then its a horrible product. There are phones as good as this out there which cost less but aren't recognized as much because Samsung has been feeding off its own overrated brand name.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"The Galaxy S9 is the perfect-sized phone. It’s easy to wrap our palms around this smooth 5.8-inch device, and our fingers ergonomically rest on the curved edges along the S9’s frame. The power button on the right edge sits in an easy-to-access position, as does the Bixby button on the left edge. It’s a shame we’ve turned off Bixby’s functionality, so the button remains useless — more on that later.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,I don't like that you can't customize much at all on this phone. The ring tones and message notification sounds aren't that good. Background and themes are so limited. Can't change message background. Can't change keyboard. I shouldn't have to download apps to customize my phone to how I want it.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,Got this as a present from my husband so I can take lots of photos and videos of our newborn. Love the camera and storage capacity. There's so many new features that I haven't yet explore but overall I am pretty happy with the functionality and battery life of the S9. It's such a pretty colour too. If someone can give me tips on how to fully utilise the phone that will be even more awesome,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"The phone is as good as the price tag suggests.. but Bixby.. with a hardware button? What is this rubbish. I hope Samsung's bloatware goes in the other direction next model (or the next model I buy).I grabbed a Gear VR for this phone (get the newer one that runs on with Note 8). Fantastic, not any really deep VR games, but it's pretty fun for a $150au add on.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,1,So frustrating. Try sending a message to a new number. Nightmare!! No write new message button. Loved my Note 4.... loath the changes on S9. Keyboard changes mean dialogue box keeps jumping because arrow buttons too close to dialogue box edges... big time buyers regret.Battery life not soo great either.. disappointed,Productreview.com.au

galaxy,5,"Fantastic phone. Awesome screen, camera and sound - with quick charge and very good software.The only Con would be having to navigate through all the Google software which literally tries to overtake your life. Not happy Google.This is my 4th Samsung phone and by far the best. Very expensive new, so I got mine pre-loved for around half price with brand new accessories.It does attract fingerprints, but it's worth it for a great looking machine.Very good job Samsung.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,Had for just over a month now and loving it. It's a step up from what I had previously but still a Samsung. Everything makes sense and much easier to use. Love the camera and wider screen from the S6. The picture is much clearer and loved how easy it was to transfer my apps across from my old phone.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,The new features on this phone are a great addition and worthy of the money. The edge of phone with short cuts great. Big storage is perfect with option of extending further. The new camera takes amazing. The new surcety fixtures options are more than perfect overall a perfect phone.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,1,This phone is confusing and badly designed always had Samsung phones this will be my last. Texting is a nightmare with its curved screen.cant figure out how to differ my ringtones. If your looking for a new phone give this one a miss.phew thanks Samsung for all the activation you have caused me.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,I switched from iPhone to Samsung and I would definitely not look back. I am very happy with my choice and I have the feeling I did a good saving. Love the shape the features and price was not bad in comparation with the similar iPhone 8. I might never get an iphone again if this is going to be so good as it's right now.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,I reluctantly upgraded from the s7 but I am pleasantly surprised with some of the new features on this model. I love the Bixby addition and no longer have to search through my phone looking for apps or programs. The sound and picture quality when playing movies is seamless and fantastic quality. My only issue was when I used smartswitch to transfer from my old to my new phone was that it didn't migrate passwords and spent a lot of time resetting passwords for apps and functions. All my net passwords were backed up my Google.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,"If this phone came without Bixby I'd give this item 4 stars. Or at least come without the need for 3rd party app to disable.Very poor button sizing, needs to be addressed.Great earphones.Getting annoyed at this fifty words requirement. When only a few can describe accurately and just as easily",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,This was a replacement upgrade phone for my partner.  An upgrade from an s5 that really highlights the changing technology in only 4 years period. A sleek and super fast machine. An outstanding camera and battery life. This is  one of the best phones I've seen. This really is a pleasure to use and with smaller screen than the s9+ it makes it easier to handle.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,Samsung have always brought out great phones but this one definitely tops them all. The camera on this model is fantastic!! The battery life is great. All the extra features and apps that they offer make my busy everyday life so much easier. I would recommend this phone to anyone!,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Samsung never ceases to amaze me with their smartphones. I have owned a Samsung Galaxy since the S4 and have upgraded to every iteration ever since. The latest S9 has exceeded all expectations and is a minor improvement over its predecessor S8. The crystal clear display and the camera are the 2 main reasons to get this phone as they beat all other phones that are currently in the market. Although the battery life for this phone can be improved, it still manages to last a whole day before the next charge.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"The camera is fantastic and I'm yet to use it to it's full potential. It's very quick, hasn't frozen on me yet.It's super easy to synch with your previous phone.The battery life could be better, I charge it most nights but that's not an issue for me.I wish it had a home button on the side rather than just an on/off button.  I turned off Bixby as it annoyed me, so now I have a button on the side that does nothing. Still better than having bixby on the whole time.I'd still get this phone again.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,4,"The layout can look busy, there are so many apps. Also, I always accidently press this button that takes you to an app, which is annoying. Not sure why theres a button for it. Other than that,  I love the camera and its features. Theres also a lot of security features you can use e.g. facial recognition.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"Bought this recently, great camera on it, but the battery life is TERRIBLE. Samsung really stuffed this up and seems like the Exynos chip is to blame that we are stuck with in Australia. If I had the choice again would probably wait a few months and get the next gen and hold onto old phone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"The S9 fulfills my expectations for the latest model from Samsung Galaxy. The design is sleek and I find it to be particularly visually appealing and ergonomic. As usual, the specifications for Samsung are fairly market  leading; the screen resolution is high, the camera is sharp etc.. The messaging functions are however slightly more challenging as I find it little bit harder to work out how to schedule messages in comparison to the previous model I owned.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,"1.) Visual aid CONSTANTLY turning on = needs a new access mode. Can't even tell you how many times I have had to go into Accessabillty to turn it off. Super annoying.2.) Bixby does NOT need a side button. Home screen icon, great. But a side button makes it (again) annoying to have to constantly swipe away.3.) And MOST IMPORTANTLY, I was told this phone was fast as heck, the best phone on the market by far. First few days, good but nothing special. Less than 2 weeks on...pitiful. I have pretty average apps on my phone. No games, etc. Clean privacy settings, etc. It is now slower than my S6. It seems like it just went kaput.      Going back to the store tomorrow.VERY DISAPPOINTED",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,The camera takes crappy pictures and when you close your phone it opens apps by itself. Bigsby is annoying and a waste of time. He/she is not very smart. I would of kept my Galaxy 7 if I knew ahead of time that this phone is garbage. Next time I'm doing my research first.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,Bought this phone about a month ago from Optus. They had the right colour (black) and is more stylish than apple products. Everyone loves the edge. Perfect size. Works very very fast. Looks beautiful. The camera is very nice One of the best smartphone out there. I recommend this phone.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,This is the first Samsung I have owned. I have used nothing but Nokia/Microsoft.I found it pretty easy to navigate and it is generally user friendly.I paid the extra money and bought the LED cover ($89.95). Not completely happy with it (its harder to hold and you cant really fold the cover completely backwards) but it is hand being able to see the time and who is calling on the LED strip (plus you can personalise their number with a picture or their name).,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,2,I don't know if I  have a  lemon but this phone is tap tap tap tap before it will go anywhere. For example it has taken nearly 15 minutes to write this ! I constantly have to check or go back to see if the function I'm  trying is occurring. I'm  extremely unhappy with spending 700.00 plus for this poor of quality  that will likely  only last 3 years at best. Money talks and that shows when Samsung and Apple control the market.,Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"This is my first Samsung/Android phone. I've been living a sheltered life trying to make do with the windows OS on previous Nokia phones which I really thought were great phones, just severely let down by Windows. So, the S9; when I first got it, it was so easy to figure out the settings to personlise to my desire. The apps and games work flawlessly so it has a strong functuonality. I have had a few freezes, but it's easily reset and works fine after a restart. The design is nice and the wireless charging is a great feature. I'll leave the nit picking of design concept and hardware to the professionals, but to the layman like me, it is great to pick up and fire away with my favorite games and apps.",Productreview.com.au

galaxy,2,"I've switched over from iphone to the Samsung Galaxy S9 and have buyers remorse! Why on earth would they build in a designated button for Bixby? The button is always accidentally touched and activates Bixby!Connectivity - despite playing around with the battery life, adjusting other settings and following all online advice, the phone seems to have trouble opening videos and certain photos, such as Instagram video reels and real estate.com photos. It will however open videos and photos at random times?? It's almost like it cannot receive that amount of data at one time. I've tried different types of WIFI and 4g/3g connections. If you're big on social media, this is a major problem and extremely annoying. The connectivity  also seems to be a problem when trying to cast from apps such as Netflix, Hayu and ABC etc., the cast symbol on the phone is dulled out meaning that it cannot pick up or sense a device to cast to. When this happens, I go straight to my 'old' iphone 6 and cast to my device. No problems.I originally switch over for the camera, which is great but with all the other issues, which are quite basic really, it hardly seems worth putting up with. I will be selling it, if I can that is and will switch back to iphone.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S9 about 2 weeks ago after being a satisfied S5 user for several years.  I instantly disliked the 'BIXBY"" feature which is so easily turned on with the switch on the left hand side. Also the background noise is so annoying!! It took some attempts through Samsung to get it deleted/removed.Since a software update yesterday it seems I can't dial local numbers without putting in the area code, including those in my Contacts. The Samsung 1300 help desk and their Chadstone store can't solve the issue and it seems it is not a problem encountered elsewhere. All settings were thoroughly checked. The Chadstone store put my SIM card in one of their phones and there was no problems. They suggested a 'reflash' of the software but I may lose data which I first need to backup.I also went to my local Telstra store and they have not encountered this issue before.So far I am not impressed with this phone, I don't see how it can be labelled a 'smart' phone.",Productreview.com.au

galaxy,1,"I recently changed from apple to samsung but I was shocked to get pop up adverts on my samsung. So this experament is over, I never had pop ups in my iPhone. The samsung is faster but at least I don't get pop up adverts while using my iPhone. Don't buy.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,5,"Upgrading from a S7, I've fallen in love with my S9, I love using it, the screen is glorious, the camera is great, it's fast and slick and with Android you can customise a lot!But on the flip side the battery life is very very challenging, I'm always charging it throughout the day. I'm getting used to the finger print reader but unlocking the phone when it's mounted in the car is challenging. Video recording is limited to 5-10 minutes in 4k unlike iPhones that record unlimited.Overall, if I had to recommend a phone in 2018, I'd go for the iPhone 8 as it has an ace battery, ace performance, ace camera, touch ID and with Apple Care you're protected in case of damage.But, I'm still very happy with my S9, as I'm an Android guy and this is the best Android phone you can get, even with all the compromises.Full In-Depth Video Review: https://youtu.be/jsmYYXq6NpA",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"Just got my new s9 was pretty excited because of all the hype surrounding it but was a bit dissapointed some features.The first being that you cant customize your ph contacts with anything. No personalized ringtone, msg tone, or even pic of your contact. Bummer.Also the super slow mo feature is really annoying in that you can only use it in short bursts when recording so your video jumps from normal speed to super slow mo & back again.If you crack the screen your looking at $500 to if get it fixed.If these things dont bother you then it's a great phone but for me, the lack of customization was a deal breaker.",Productreview.com.au
galaxy,3,"This phone does have some practical issues. With a protective screen cover the touch screen on the smooth edge is difficult to use. The other problem is lack of the home, return and screen buttons on the bottom which i had on the s6 makes it difficult for navigation. Every thing else is great but these issues lowered my over all opinion.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,1,"There are 2 types of iPhone X uses.  Those who have dropped their phone (and lightened their wallet) and those that soon will.It took Apple years to get up to speed with larger screens on the iPhone and when they did, they literally made them as fragile as glass.  Everybody drops their phone sometime and making it with materials this breakable is ridiculous.  When you drop it, it will break and the cost of a new screen is A$450+I now use mine as a home handset, I rarely will carry it with me.  Too expensive an item to risk damage which defeats its purpose almost entirely.You can buy a robust case, and you should, but that will destroy the aesthetic if that was part of the reason you bought one and still doesn't guarantee it won't break when you drop it.  Also beware of folio style cases which hold the phone with magnets, with a small bump, they will let go when you least expect it.I'll keep mine until 5G rolls out and then buy a large screen phone from a competitor.

iphone,5,"This is the best iPhone since my iPhone 6 plus. I had iPhone 3, 4, 5, 6 plus and 7 plus and this is the big step that I was waiting finally a device with a big screen that can fit in my pocket and use with one hand.Just for the Oled screen is worth to buy and if you compare to an LCD like the Xr there will be always a big gap and the screen is the most important feature in a mobile now.Yes it is expensive but it is worth the money as finally it feels like a phone ready for the future and face id works perfectly after a week with face id you would not like to go back to touch id and I was previously thinking touch id is the best.Best part I just also got a new battery replacement for free so my iPhone might last perfectly till 2020 for the iPhone 5g but iPhone xi will bring an important feature: USB C type",Productreview.com.au

They are NOT splash or water proof at all ( They say up to 2mtrs for up to 30 min ! Load of bull ) The apple representative said there is no warranty on any iphone for any liquid damage no matter what, it has an IP rating of IP 68. Who knows what that means unless you are an apple employee.I have had over 10 i phones and now that i need a repair for water damage they knock you back instantly because its "" liquid damage "".I asked him if it was damaged by rain falling on it would he cover the warranty and he said NO, because its 68 IP rating.The phone is amazing BUT its NOT water proof nor resistant as they state.ITS FALSE ADVERTISING end of story.This should not be allowed as its misleading to consumers",Productreview.com.au

iphone,4,The phone could break easy as it is glass front and back so you will need a screen protector or case.

iphone,3,The camera is better. Scream is sharp but they took off the night time yellow screen from the drop down menu. It's too heavy. Wish there is a smaller version and more colours choices.

iphone,3,The iPhone X is a great working phone the battery life on it is amazing and the camera quality is quite impressive as well. However I find having no home button quite annoying at times. You can’t just quickly tap on the home button when in an app you have to drag the bottom section of the screen up to the top of the screen. I also find turning the phone off quite difficult as well as you have to hold down two separate buttons. Other than that it’s a great phone.,Productreview.com.au

iphone,5,iPhone X is the perfect size and has an incredible camera. Camera allows for better quality than before and has a portrait mode for both cameras (front facing and back).At night it features a setting which allows flash in front facing camera to help for clear pictures.

Only time it runs slow is right before it’s about to die at 1%,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Love it, pretty easy to use but just too expensive. Was using Android before and now switching it to iPhone simply because it is easier to navigate through the phone and everything is simply and straight forward. The only let down is probably that I can’t upgrade my storage like I did with Samsung",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"It unlocks pretty fast using the Face ID, charges pretty quickly and the camera quality is to die for! My youngest son who is 10 got this when it first came out and loves it.

It's such a great iPhone, we love it!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I have had every iPhone since the 3G. I had the iPhone 8+ previously to this (there were not that many upgrades between the 6+ and the 8+ as it was). Honestly, the software didn’t do much. Sure, you got Animojis but you rarely use them. The camera wasn’t noticeably different in quality.Face ID is fine, no complaints. But when it comes to running - apps close, the phone freezes (will go black with no reason and might respond a couple of minutes later after pressing the side button quite a few times).Having no home button can be a pain, especially for hard resets or trying to see the bottom of the screen.Here’s to hoping Apple actually really upgrades next years model (not this years XS & XS Max) - there’s been very little improvements over the last few years and it’s disappointing.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Very satisfied with my purchase of the iPhone X. I was previously using the 7 and was scared to switch to the X due to its advertised size. I only realised later that the screen size of the iPhone X compared to the 7 isn't that much different due to the new OLED display which takes up most of the screen space. Very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend buying the iPhone X now. Was thinking of buying the iPhone XS but as the price was still high decided against it and got a pre-owned iPhone X instead which saved me about $700.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Durability and brighntess of phone is great, apps run smoothly and camera is terrific! Getting used to not having the home button is fine.

iphone,4,"Camera: Let me start this off by saying I am a 20-something individual so camera quality is everything to me. I love the iPhone X cameras (front and back). Great for taking pictures in all lighting and great pre-editing features to make your pics pop. You'll probably like the camera.Durability: I have dropped my phone on any surface imaginable and I still have not cracked it. For me, that's a definite win because I am notoriously clumsy. I have also dropped my phone in the bath, pool and shower. Still perfect (bonus if you have a case)General Use: It calls and texts. The screen brightness is great. There are also a lot of random features that you never think you will need until you need them. I work a lot on my computer and I love that I could also actually work from my phone. The full screen is great for watching videos too - the notch is a bit annoying though. The Face ID is great and gets better as you continue to use it. It now recognizes my face (and not the face of others) in nightclubs, when I have my sunglasses and  glasses on, and even when I am in bed. It took about a month for my phone to recognize my face in all these ""environments""OS and Apps: Apps and OS are standard. I have had a bit of trouble using the Beta iOS's though but these issues are usually fixed pretty quickly.BATTERY LIFE: This is where the iPhone X is a bit of a bummer. Admitedly, I use my phone a lot but I find that my battery health has deteriorated pretty quickly with this phone. My battery runs out pretty quickly when listening to music. I probably get about 3/4 of a day before I need to recharge again for the night. The wireless charging is great though, especially when I am at work. I can charge my phone wirelessly and listen to music using the port =.Basically: it's an iPhone.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,4,"I purchased the international model from Kogan,It was a good phone, everything worked well, however I decided to sell it and downgrade due to the fact that it was quite expensive, I wanted to get rid of it before the value fell due to the release of the newer models.

Otherwise there are cheaper options that give you similar features.",Productreview.com.au

Phones with good reception have a blue tick given by Telstra or classed as good for regional from Optus both to date have not given anything on the reception.People after a the iPhone for us in the rural or country areas should not even bother with the new model iPhone X models as they will have very poor reception even for people in the city. (Telstra gives a ""Blue Tick"" for phones that have good reception).The duel sim could have helped people in rural  or pleaces with limited reception from one carrier but using 2 sims might have helped using 2 different carriers.Duel sim could have even helped people who traveled a lot over sea's as well so they could turn off there data to sim and put another sim so they could use the data from the area the country they where traveling in.We are the user the customer and we should be able to have control over the items we want and wish to buy.But the Telcos controle these things based on profits.So from me to anyone wanting to buy any iPhone please find out the Battery life or what reception it has if its poor do not buy it.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,4,"The iPhone X has adopted the most varied design language in recent years, keeping up with the full-screen trend and raising the upper limit of the overall screen design of the entire industry. If you ignore the left, right and bottom borders, iPhone X's screen ratio can easily kill all kinds of Android full screen emperor. However, due to the screen display technology, these extra frames are a last resort.In addition to being ugly by people, the iPhone X's Qi Liuhai is very unfriendly to the application. Basically, the application for adaptation is also chosen to avoid Qi Liu, instead of using the space around the bangs. In addition to the bangs, the seemingly beautiful rounded corner design is also a headache for developers.",Productreview.com.au

It’s very expensive though and possibly not worth the price, however if it’s your primary device then you might be able to justify the purchase.

iphone,4,"I do love this phone. It’s easy and quick to type as my last s6 phone is terrible for the keyboard. Siri isn’t as good as I was hoping it would be. She cannot make calls or write notes or take screenshots like google assistant could. It’s bright and the camera takes stunning images. In landscape mode, the shots are a lot narrower than the Samsung’s though which is a little annoying. Still has a much better picture. It feels nice and weighty in my hand. Solid and sturdy. The screen is bright. I enjoy the navigation by swiping up and around though I am still yet to discover how to turn it on and off, I could google it but have just been lazy. The one thing I truly despise on the iPhone though is the Apple App Store. Even if you type the exact name of an app it’ll show what it thinks is more popular first, nesrly every app you need to pay for and if it’s free it isn’t really as it has in app purchases. You’re unable to save any apps in a Wishlist type thing like you can on android either. I think android wins in the app department but Apple definitely wins with the camera and navigating around the phone. The iPhone X has widgets but they’re all confined to the far left screen and are basically useless. I like on my s6 being able to customise my screen with apps, folders and widgets. The x is simple but I would prefer it to have this feature. It’s a good phone. Not as great as I was hoping but good.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,5,"I thought I'd splurge and get the iPhone X as I have other Apple products- a 2017 MacBook Pro and iPad Pro 10.5"" to be precise. You can either purchase the device outright (roughly $1600 for the 64GB model), or go on a contract (the latter obviously spreads the cost over 24 months (or 36 with Vodafone)). I love how Apple removed the home button as it was annoying to reach down to go home/authenticate purchases on my old iPhone SE. Face ID, contrary to what some people say, is so easy and seamless. One glance, and the iPhone X unlocks/authenticates payments via Apple Pay. The ability to charge the phone wirelessly is a nice advantage, too. Can't tell you how many times I've tried to plug my phone in at night, only to miss the charging port completely because it's been dark. With wireless charging, it's as easy as placing the iPhone X down on the wireless charging mat (which is obviously purchased separately). If you do decide to take the plunge and purchase the iPhone X, insurance is a must as it's all-glass design feels very delicate. I'd also strongly recommend getting a good case too (Tech21 make great cases in case you're wondering).What I like:Wireless chargingWater resistanceGesture-based UIFace IDWhat I dislike:Nothing at this stageIf you want all the latest and greatest features and can afford to splurge, I'd totally recommend the iPhone X. Otherwise, it may be worth checking out the iPhone 8 if you want a great, reliable iPhone and don't have $1600 (or can't afford to spend $100+ a month).",Productreview.com.au
iphone,1,"I feel I need to warn other users of the flagship Apple iPhone X of something that happened to me while on holidays this May.I took out my $1800+ iPhone X in the rain to take 4-5 images. Supposedly the phone is water resistant at 1m depth for 30 minutes (IP67)...... Well I need to warn everyone that it is NOT resistant to 60 seconds in some rain. I now have an expensive paperweight which Apple will not replace or fix without the payment of $800+.Apple have inspected the phone and have verified that there is water inside it. I cannot dispute that this is the case, but it is the circumstances of the water getting in that is the frustration for me.Taking a water resistant phone out to take 5 images should not result in the phone becoming inoperable.This is a major disappointment after paying a premium for an expensive piece of hardware. I have had more than 16 apple devices linked to my apple id and have never returned or made a claim against an apple product and I have owned many since 1984.I also feel that to advertise the phone as water resistant is misleading if the IP67 rating is 1m deep water for 30 minutes how could I ever have ruined the phone by my hand as it was only damp/wet for a short period and then returned to my dry pocket.Anyway a shout-out to Australia Post Insurance for covering the repairs / replacement of the iPhone which has now been sold and replaced with the Huawei P20 Pro.I will never buy an overpriced apple product again with claims of being able to perform beyond its capabilities.

My thumb automatically goes to switch it on however the facial recognition unlocks the phone straight away and you just have to swipe up to unlock (no thumbprint required!) the facial recognition works really well at night time/dark lighting too I’ve noticed, which is pretty neat. Only downside for me is you have to chose between 64 gigs or 256 - and on my iPhone 7 I’ve used about 3/4 of my 128 gigs.

iphone,5,I have had my iphoen x for a few months and it is amazing everything about it is awesome the water proof feather is amazing and means I can take it scuba diving and take videos Evan with out a case on the only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have a head phone jack bit I use Bluetooth head phones and have no problem,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Ive always had Iphones since they first came out so I know how to use them.  This was the main reason I stayed with Apple rather than buying a Samsung.  Then I had to choose which Apple iPhone to buy.  The reason I chose the iPhone X was because the screen is bigger than the previous models ... it pretty much takes up the whole of the front of the phone which means that its better when I watch youtube or netflix on it, its better when I take photos or videos... its just better for pretty much everything you do on the phone.  In my opinion the phone has a better operating system than any of the previous models....for example google maps seems to work on it really well... also it seems more efficient to do tasks and does them faster than the previous models I have owned.  I could have got an Oppo for a lot less... but I've gone with a cheaper model before and then had to live with it for a couple of years so I don't do that anymore.  Im very happy with the iPhone X.  Without a doubt it is the best phone I've owned and id recommend it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,It is a very good phone. You can quickly get used to it’s touch screen. Face recognition makes everything easier you don’t have to type or use finger print. Rest is typical iPhone features. it looks a bit delicate so it is a good idea to buy sturdy phone cover and screen protector.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"I have had my iphone X for approximately 8 months.  I am happy enough with it but it didn't blow me away compared to the iphone 7 I had previous to this model.  The face-ID can be annoying as it takes awhile to unlock, especially when I'm at work at my desk and don't want to have to keep holding my phone up to unlock it.  At the end of the day it does the job, yet costs a lot.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Apple does it again, you can tell me till the cows come home how great the androids are but they all miss the point where Apple just excels, Apple products just work and make everything so intuitive, so much so that a small child can use without any help. I cannot tell you how great this phone is, just love it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I bought the Iphone X out right for its amazing camera and special features. It achieved beyond my greatest expectations, i wanted a good camera to take to europe with me, then thought i could have an all in one good camera and phone together!

iphone,5,"Apple launched the phone back in November and I was in need of an upgrade from my iPhone 6+ to iPhone X. It is my current phone for day to day use. The battery can easily last for the whole day and I have never been more satisfied with the quality of the customer service and the phone build quality. They are superb!The camera of course has improved, which is good to see. I was able to take better pictures. And the selfie camera is also a huge bonus! I was able to take better quality selfies when being outdoors.Only downside is the price of the phone and how easily prone to screen cracking it is.Otherwise, if you have the money and you have an older iPhone, this phone is definitely for you!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,1,"Purchased X Apple phone. After three months the phone kept frezzing, battler went flat after 4 hours and calls cutting out. Returned to Apple Doncaster with my receipt.

iphone,3,It’s good and nice to use but sometimes when it freezes u just can’t press anything and that’s makes it a bit annoying but i like it and i got used l to it.

iphone,4,"The hardware is awesome it really is but it is let down by the buggy software, come on Apple pick up your game!! Fingers crossed for ios12.They released an oled panel without any kind of dark mode which is just silly, they are clearly going to use it as a selling point come next model,Face ID works well enough that I will say I see why Apple believes it’s the future, If it had a slightly wider fov and was a bit snappier it would feel so natural you would forget it exists. I already do most of the time.Forget about the notch, this phone has absolutely no chin and no top bezel just this notch, the edges are well thought out because any thinner you would have trouble with accidentally touching the sides of the screen.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Bought this phone from Vodafone. It is the best phone ever. Pictures are absolutely stunning and beautiful. Good look and stylish phone. Charge really fast. Very light and good size phone. The service we received from Vodafone online service is absolutely good and I want to thank for their fast delivery service. Love the phone.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,2,Bought an iphone X for my girl friend December last year. I think it's not worth of the price official claimed. Most fancy designs are not friendly to use for example Face ID can't really recogonize you well if you are in the dark environment. Ugly wireless headphone (AirPod). So called 'OLED' glass end up heavier and more fragile than previous ones.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Love my iPhone X! It’s such a beautiful phone so simple and easy to use.So easy to use and an amazing camera as well.If you want something easy and classy the iPhone X is the perfect phone for you!Only downside is the battery life doesn’t last that long and after a month of having my phone my battery health is now on 99%,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Near the end of financial year purchasing, in David Jones, gave a welcome disscount,  some kind of 120 dollar minimise than the retail shop of Apple.

Took it back to Apple and they said that it’s not their problem that “their” software is not working properly.So the conclusion is, I bought the top of the range iPhone and paid so much for it just to have it being the worst performing phone I have ever come across. Also so many people are having problems with it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I purchased this phone a couple of months ago and have been using it everyday since, I think it’s a very good sized phone and model looks good.

iphone,5,"My wife uses this phone, and like my SE iPhone, she loves it like I do. Because of the Touch ID and all being very handy, is the one reason for it to be popular.

iphone,5,"This is the perfect phone, had so many features and the Face ID is the best because it give that extra security and it’s easy to use, I also find the glass is a lot stronger than usual, I’ve dropped my phone multiple times and it still hasn’t broken. Very happy.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"This phone is very average; it is actually a complete disappointment as compared to previous iPhone models -- though the screen size is bigger than any other iPhone model, the reduced size of the physical phone it self makes it difficult to adjust to using it over the previous ""plus"" models.  It has a fast processor and the wireless charging as well as the water resistance of the device are great features, but I feel that it is extremely overpriced as compared to older models.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Moving from an iphone 7 to the X, I was sceptical about the screen size and it it really made a difference... wow, was I shocked. The phone itself is not much bigger and certainly smaller than the plus, but the screen is so much bigger. Now when I go back to a standard 7, the screen is so small in comparison. Highly recommended.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,5,"Absolutely amazing phone even though it is slightly overpriced it is still an absolutely classy phone which makes it stand out of the crowd.

iphone,5,"Great phone but the only issue i have is the screen.. it doesn't work like the iphone 8, the other thing that's really hard to get used to is the fact there is no home button, not sure if i regret this or not. Speed wise and battery life A+++++.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,2,one month into its ownership and the glass on the screen is broken by just a fall from table to floor. Did not know it was so brittle whilst apple lauded about it being durable.

iphone,2,"I am extremely disappointed with the iphone X, being an Apple Fan since iphone 3. It is not user friendly, esp. the photo take of your screen, the shut off button, the torchlight, etc etc. If I have not invested $1000+ for this phone, I would have gotten rid of it! The iphone 6 Plus was a much better innovation by far.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,Love this phone but its definitely overpriced. I've had it since the first week and love the screen. The UI is nice. I dislike their advertising of IP rating water resistant and do not trust it at all. I have already had one phone break on me due to rain.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Love it! Took a little while to get used to the features but once it’s become second nature I have loved it!

iphone,1,I would definately not recommend this phone. Only dropped it once ( on carpet) and the screen cracked immediately . Screen is now possessed and typing random letter. I Only dropped it once and now it’s playing up. It will now cost me 600 to fix the screen. I had an IPhone 6 before and would drop it but never broke the screen.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,This is a just amazing and fast phone. best in Iphone series. Face detection work awesomely. Camera clarity is also goodcomparatively another phone. Happy with using i phone X.

iphone,4,"The phone is amazingly fast, photos are almost as good as a DSLR. Face unlock is great. The only downside is the very high price.Highly recommended if you're able to pay through the nose to one of the Telcos for the absurdly high priced plans (mine is a work phone, lucky me, otherwise I damn sure wouldn't be paying over $100 a month for ANY phone!).A product is amazing - you just need to carefully assess the value situation.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"This phone has one of THE best cameras I have ever possessed in a mobile phone, though I am not very happy that they got rid of the Touch ID as it makes the phone less practical.

iphone,4,"The iPhone X is overall a good phone. I have not had any problems so far, yet I have only had it for 3 months. The camera quality is the best out of all the other iPhones I have had.

iphone,4,"I purchased my iPhone X in November 2017.Generally speaking, it done what it is suppose to.

iphone,3,"The good bits: Face ID - love it.  Enhanced camera functions.Not so good: Quite heavy.  Storage options are limited.  Closing apps and screens has an extra step required (from previous phones and current ipad) - unnecessary and annoying.The bad: Overpriced for what it delivers.  Not much to recommend as a ""flagship"" 10 year anniversary.  I'd had 4 iphones over 8 years and this is the most underwhelming.No headphone jack and NO ear-buds included in exorbitant pricing.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I LOVE this phone! Until now, I have mostly used my mobile for internet searching and a bit of social media. With such amazing quality on the iPhone X cameras, I have stopped using my DSLR and now use my phone solely for all photography. The AR is amazing and the available    AR apps work seamlessly on this phone. I have friends with other brands and see considerable lag on their phones. I wasn’t sure how I was going to cope without a home button and Touch ID but Face ID is AMAZING and the extra screen space is really great. I’m loving this phone and highly recommend it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,Good phone and much easier to use the shortcuts than the last versions. Takes a little bit of getting used to.

iphone,5,I love this iPhone because it’s  very unique and it is the newest iPhone. It feels fairly light and has a good colour. It’s  fast for playing games and isn’t slow like the other iPhones for gaming. I definitely would recommend to my friends and family without a doubt. The Touch ID I said very unique as well.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,I have an Iphone X and it's really good for your everyday needs. There's decent battery life and phone storage. There's sometimes hiccups when it struggles to recognise whether you are looking at the phone horizontally or vertically but you can turn that function off. The headphones have a different plug so if you have your usual headphone cord then you've got to plug it in a different connector to use your headphones. The headphone plug in this phone is also the power plug,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I don’t have one to give as the phone is great. I can not fault this phone as I work in age care and helps in every way posible. If I had to have a negative it would be the battery but I am useing and depending on it a lot.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,1,"When i first bought this, I thought that it looked like such a good looking device, glass all over and wireless charging sounded like I had finally caught up with my old Android, but alas I was disappointed again. The glass on all sides aren't gorilla glass, but are so Apple knockoff which purports to be stronger, but is more brittle and chips easily. The display is good, nothing you wouldn't get on a Galaxy S8, or hell even an S9. The real defining feature is its lack of things, lack of headphone jack, lack of fingerprint reader, lack of intelligence I had to have to think this was a good phone. Seriously though, who is this designed for? Its tech is so outdated, processor so slow, screen so Meh. At least the glass is nice. Also the camera tech on the front is from the company that made the original Xbox Kinect sensor, compared to the new one, that thing is a joke. Apple can you please for the love of God resurrect Steve Jobs, it will be your only chance of survival.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This is the best phone I’ve ever owned. The safety of the facial recognition is awesome. I use the Apple Pay feature on a regular basis and have never had a problem, rarely carry my wallet anywhere anymore. Easy to use for someone that isn’t very tech savvy. Will stick with Apple for all future purchases (even our iPad is used everyday). Just wish the screen didn’t get cut off for videos or apps that hadn’t updated for the X.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I really love the iPhone X. It’s smooth and responsive. The new gestures make it much quicker to get where you want to go and FaceID is heaps more convenient than TouchID. Only one issue: it’s too big. Doesn’t fit in any of the places that are normally designed for phones, like the specially designed phone compartment in my car. I guess when it was built phones were generally smaller. Can’t wait for an SE-sized X!",Productreview.com.au

iphone,5,"It was certainly a challenge working out this phone as it was quite different not having a home button but I love the changes and differences. The size for me is perfect, I almost got the bigger phone and I am glad I didn't. Apple has always been my go to with products, I have had no problems with it and the battery lasts a long time. I love the screen to edge screen, it makes the phone look really good. I overall love my iPhone X, amazing purchase.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I purchased my iPhone X back in January 2018.I had to update because my iPhone 6 pluswas dying and even after I had replaced the battery on the 6 plus it was still becoming clunky...but back to the X.Ticked all the boxes except a few.  I was almost disappointed in going back to the smaller hand set size even though the screen size more than makes up for it.  I think I was just used to the larger phone size.  However it didn't take long to get used to the size and face recognition.  It doesn't miss a beat (except for when I am wearing sunglasses which is a tad annoying). But a good safety feature none the less.Camera is much better, battery life is a dream compared to my 6 plus but in saying that it would be nice to go back to the days of not having to charge your phone every day.It feels well made and does everything it's supposed to do. I am absolutely loving the new 'portrait' mode in the camera.  It does take a really nice picture.However like all technology there are some glitches.  I have found (and asked other X users who have confirmed the same) that when sending multiple photos via iMessage that it freezes up and will only send one at a time.  This can be very frustrating at times.The phone works fast and meets my needs of working at a fast pace and needing it on the go. So far it really hasn't missed a beat.  But given it has only been used for 4 months you would expect a new phone to be just that.The cost was, in my opinion, very high.  I had to save my pennies for this one!I just hope that this phone continues to function like this for quite a while.  So fingers crossed!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,2,"I was happy with my iPhone 6, then suddenly it became so glitchy that I had to upgrade to iPhone X and fork out $1800 for no reason at all.

I feel Apple scammed me to buy this by slowing my iPhone 6 hence 2 star",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I've been an Apple iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and have loved all the developments they’ve included over the years.  Using the phone for work means having a complex pass code so when fingerprints become a authentication method it was so fast and easy.  Since the iPhone X now used facial recognition I find that I’m having to manually enter the passcode more often than the old fingerprint.  Simple use cases like unlocking the phone when in bed with your face half buried in a pillow, sitting in the car with the phone in a cradle on the windscreen are meaning more often having to manually enter a PIN whereas I never had this problem with fingerprints.  Other than that iOS is great and I love the features, cameras and processor speed.  Also like the integration into Apple watch.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The updates on this phone compared to previous iPhones makes a difference - it has become much more user friendly with closing apps, no home button, the Face ID unlock, it’s a very good size, it’s water resistant.

iphone,4,"Best camera and great phone has heaps of awesome features, awesome camera and video recording.

iphone,5,Where do I start everything about the iPhone X is fantastic especially having the ability to log in with your eyes to your phone and things like emails bank accounts that means no more passwords your eyes r your password! And we all know the finger print scanner does not work in the rain or when u get out of the shower or the pool or when u have gloves on so it’s a fantastic feature. The size of the phone is great as well and u have so much real estate as it’s and edge to edge display.just on display it’s fantastic very natural colours and easy to see in the sunlight. The design and build quality is great to so pop down and have a look at getting one you won’t regret it oh yeah apart from the price if that’s not an issue I’d say get one as it’s the best phone on the market at this point,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Was apprehensive when making this purchase due to the price tag, however I have no regrets. The Face ID is very intuitive and functions much better than expected.

But for something that is such an integral part of my daily life, I'm happy to spend the $.I hesitated with this model - was a big fan of Touch ID, and didn't like the idea of Face ID, but now it's one of my favourite features. I have gone from a 7plus to the X, so smaller phone, bigger screen. Very happy as I have small hands and it's easier to use. I do find it a big long though - lots of videos etc don't use the full screen which is a shame. Photos and videos are fantastic quality.Everything else is pretty much same as always. Shared calendars, notes and photo albums are great for our family, my life would fall apart without it!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Great phone to use, very user-friendly, quite hard in the beginning though since it comes without a home button. Great camera takes great photos and great videos as well. Incredibly light smartphone. The best piece of technology so far.However bought mine 3 weeks ago and has crashed already for no reason. Put it on charge the previous night before going to bed and woke up the next day and it was gone. Plugged into the charger few times a day and still nothing. I have to use my old iphone 6s while looking at fixing or replacing the iphone x. Apparently this issue is a common issue with this new piece of technology. Let me tell you, i have had the iphone 3 for 3 years, the iphone 5 for 3 years, the iphone 6s for nearly three years too, and never had such a problem with an iphone. My iphone 6s has never crashed, never crashed the screen and it works well until now. But i keep saying that the iphone x is a great smartphone. Apple just need to fix that crash issue and things should go pretty nice for this phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Great smart device built with user experience in mind. Intuitive interface, clear and bright vivid screen, plenty of real estate. Web pages look great. Strong audio performance too make for interesting  multimedia performance. Owned for 6 months now. No issues with performance or lagging. Speedy start up and fast rendering make a great overal package",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Its understandable the top notch of all that Apple have made. Ok so there are a few flaws yes as every phone. Yet the positives highly outweigh the minute negatively. I enjoy the camera, its clarity and the ability for the phone to function as I'm having many screens open. Luv it. Full fan. But one",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The iPhone X is truly undefeated. It is so simple yet so intricate. It has everything you need and I will never go back! I use this phone for everything in my daily life, it’s replaced all my other gadgets. Not to mention how safe it is , with the new Face ID.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"This phone provides facial recognition which is a more personalised approach compared to just the fingerprint scanners. The camera quality achieved is excellent with great detail and allowing to focus on images in a precise manner. There are also added options of portrait and other features. Even so, battery length is considered average with it lasting a full day but without excessive use.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I really like my iPhone X. I like being able to use gestures such as swiping the bottom edge to switch between apps. So much so that I keep doing that gesture on other people’s older iPhones too LOL.It’s got a great camera too.I just think it shouldn’t be so damn expensive. It’s way too overpriced for what it is.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"It is an Iphone yayy. Can't fault it. It has been excellent. Upgraded from iPhone 7s so it is a big improvement.The only bad things I can find is the price. these phones are expensive. paid mine 1400+dollar. The iphone X accessory are expensive too compared to other model. Overall, love it, can't live without it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Definitely not worth the money that they charge you. I own a vast amount of Apple products. I bought 3 iPhone X’s all in protective cases. One was put in an otter box protective case that was recommended by Apple employees.A few months after purchase the phone fell off a table not more than half a metre high and the back glass on the phone shattered. It’s was such a small fall. The camera glass was fine. Spoke to Apple about fixing it and apparently you have to replace the entire phone at $800+AU if you don’t have Apple care which is $300 AU plus $100 to replace the phone, which is half the price of replacement if you don’t have Apple care.Prior to this accident the faceId camera was not working on this phone. Apple wouldn’t even look at it and their diagnostics apparently don’t tell them anything about this issue and how long it has failed for which is convenient for them. Now they refuse to open the phone because the back glass is broken.Apple have become the biggest joke in the industry building inferior products all the while increasing their prices dramatically.I would recommend an iPhone 8 or another brand of phone. I Would never recommend the iPhone X To anyone. It is just not worth even half of what they charge for it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This iphone x is the best phone I have ever usedI really like the edge which a largen your screenIt works fine and the size is just fits for my jeans pocket, the only thing that i do not like is I bought the 64gb one, I should buy the 256gb oneI also like how the iphone app detect my face to different animals as it is so funny! Hope this will help.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"it's pricey, but it is the best iphone, i have used.  The Face id works like a charm.  gone are the days, when I have to enter passwords for each and every damn app, face id just unlocks it. It works also in dark. the camera is excellent and so is the quality of the pics.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,LIke guys seriously the iPhone x is so good. I know it's pricey but it worths. The shape is amazing. However material made it become a little bit slippery. If you don't use a case yah you might need to pay a new screen...The function is good. The camera is super nice!!!!,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"So after getting the new iPhone it had everything included which was awesome as I’ve always had a second hand phone. I love the way it feels, the way it runs, takes photos & videos. I’m in love with the big screen and the battery life is so great! I’ve recommended it to everyone!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,2,"I recently purchased iPhoneX via optus 12 month plan. I am paying $140 after 25% student discount. While I got addicted to the new bigger screen quickly soon I realised its not worth the price. Surely will be sustainable as it is an apple product, but iphone 7/8 does the same job at a much lower price.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I love most things about this phone. The big screen is great. The face recognition is fantastic (when it works, most of the time.) The face recognition auto fills passwords for you and gives you access without a pin. It does seem to take ages to charge but I don’t often run out of battery so I guess that’s ok. Most important to me is that the camera is good. I think it’s fantastic, with the only drawback being that sometimes moving subjects blur. One issue that I have had is that my initial restore never fully completed and I unfortunately lost a small amount of data, which occasionally is problematic. Another issue is that the uploading of photos to iCloud never seems to fully complete either, so my shared photo streams aren’t updating. Overall though I am happy with this purchase.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Ok so I currently have an iPhone X through Vodafone but the only downside to this phone is the fact that the whole phone is made out of glass, like super super THIN glass. I had my phone for around a month before it fell on the floor (with a case and screen protector on) and the whole thing shattered to pieces. I was unable to use it at all as little pieces of glass were coming out, worst part is that Apple apparently couldn’t repair the back of the phone and I would have to pay $800 for a new one through them, thankfully since it’s imsured I got it way cheaper through my phone company. Still very scary since you are paying $1000 upwards for a phone and it breaks with one small drop, needs sturdier glass :(",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,The iphone X is a very similar version to its previous models which makes me wonder why a person would spend so much on a new phone. However an apple is an apple is an apple. The focus alot on the camera which should not be the only point of focus.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The screen is large enough to let me watch videos and the surface looks really professionalBut one of the thing is I cannot use the normal earphone, i need to put an adapter in. There’s a lot of option of phone case i can choose which is really good as i used android previously and there’s not much phone case option that i can choose",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The iPhone X is a great phone, Apple try to innovate each year and they did kind of do it. The iPhone X is a lot different to previous versions. I guess that the iPhone 8 is the safe version and the iPhone X is the innovative one. Great device, not sure if it is worth the $2000 price tag.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,The iPhone X didn’t exceed my expectations but I did come to like it. The best thing about the new phone is the lack of home button. You don’t realise how convenient it is to just swipe up and not have to press down on a home button until you go back and use the older iPhone models.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Pros:An outstanding cameraA long lasting battery life (although Apple's current slowing down of phones scandal is something to think about)Very fast at performing tasksSlim bezels (notch is no longer noticeable after using for a couple of weeks or so)Great customer service.Cons:Still prefer touchiDNo headphone jackStill a wonderful phone though,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,I bought this phone around 2 months ago. I think it is a great phone but not the 1500 dollars I spent on it. I don't like the fact that is doesn't have a home button on all phones should have. but it shows no signs of slowing down and if your looking for a long lasting phone this is definitely worth it.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Have been using for 2 months now, and this phone is phenomenal. The design is nice and slim, the screen is very vibrant and the minimal bezels are awesome. The notch is not as bad as people say it is as I didn't notice it after using it for a week. The camera is awesome, with DSLR level quality photos and the face id is a lot.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Have used it for a monthmayprosvery fast, excellent customer support from apple, no lags, the bazzels look awesome, face id, very good battery life, amazing cameraconsno headphone jacks, have to use itunes for everything cant just transfer files like android, no fingerprint sensor, very expensiveI may never go back to android and i hope apple continue to upgrade this model.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Love everything about this phone except the price tag. Screen looks beautiful, performance is awesome, camera takes crisp photos and the phone is so easy to use. Would I recommend it over the iPhone 8/8 plus? Only if you can afford to cough up $1,579 + accessories to protect the phone!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Upgraded from a iphone 6. Took a while to get used to no home button, but seems obsolete now. Face id is really handy when trying to access phone when your hands are full. Portrait mode on the camera is a big bonus. Larger screen area good, and it comes with a headphone jack so not having to buy this was a nice surprise. Love it",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I have always enjoyed the basic and easy way of iPhone's but have always wanted to change brands as the camera quality was always the same with each new design. Yet as the iPhone X came out i got it and was blown away, it was actually really good and i'm honestly really pleased with it as a apple product.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I know how I ever got by without this phone. Absolutely amazing! It is easy to use, stylish, heaps of apps available and I love all of the colours. Apple has done a great job in the development with the phone. I tell all of my friends that they need to get one.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Totally worth the price. I got mine on launch day from optus and was instantly blown away with this phone, i had upgraded from the iphone 6 i immediately was able to adapt the the loss of the home button and am quite happy without it. I love the face ID and have never had a problem with it, it quickly adapts to changes such as sunglasses. the Camera is amazing and takes the best photos effortlessly, features are great and the phone fits in the palm of my small hands easily. I would never go back to another style of iphone and i hope apple continue to upgrade this model.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,My recent purchase of the iPhone X is my fourth Apple iPhone and each model has been a delightful improvement in both capability and capacity.  I really like it’s intuitive operating system and the new added gestures make it even easier and faster to use. It is robust and easy to handle and I have no complaints regarding its design or operation. Great product!,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Love it, love it, love it. Really good phone, has so many features, nice and smooth, touch works great, Apple has really stepped up in this model only screen size needed to be little larger but I still love it, it’s really excellent phone to use and has excellent camera too.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Good Phone better than previous models however one thing I am not happy is the camera at the back is not flat so if you put the phone down it will first hit/scratch the camera lens thus very disappointing. Otherwise, the camera is good, features are great nothing to complain compared to S8+ android phone. Small handly fits in palm",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Great camera, takes good quality photos even when the subject is moving it still tends to get a clear pic. Nice big screen. Torch is brighter than previous iPhones. Very responsive. Lock screen can be a buggy sometimes (when entering passcode to unlock screen). All in all pretty happy with this phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Get it on the plan. It's good but however, at this price, you have to ask for a higher standard.- The face ID doesn't work perfectly. At least not as smooth as the touch ID- Many apps don't support the screen size- Why can't we have 128Gb?",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"i got it from a phone plan, but I wouldn’t buy it and spend $1500 on it while I can get other phones with the same features for less. After a while, the phone also starting to slow down. What I like about it though is the high def display.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"As I said, love the screen and camera. Camera significantly improved especially in evening shots. But the phone still has lots of bugs, hence my rating.Sometimes it glitches when I need do answer the call, it doesn't want to swipe. Otherwise very responsive, but overpriced smart phone. Thanks.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Love my Apple products and this new addition has some added bonuses from the past phones. The security features, ease of use and the nice slim design is what Apple is known for. The device works very well, is fast at processing and has an awesome battery life (always could be better).",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Definitely recommend this phone has been the best iPhone so far, If you’re wanting a better camera and a smaller phone also lighter with better battery life suggest looking at this. You’ll be happy with the outcome.  Was thinking about Samsung but if you’re an apple person stay all Apple.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Apple has finally made an improvement with this iPhone, more memory, better camera, greater features & a much larger screen to make things clearer. I am finally loving my new iPhone, after missing the home button for a week or two, I have become used to it not being there.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,just bought the iphone x recently with my friend. I would recommend buy a case that is strong enough to protect the phone or it could break. But the features are mind blowing and is extremely worth its price like the Animoji like that is the best and the Face ID is also awesome,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I actually thought that I wouldn't like this phone, but i am totally in love with it. It takes a little bit to get used to the fact it has no home button, and all the new gesture controls you need to learn, but once you do there is no turning back. I really love the face ID as well.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,1,"I don't want to change my other appliances to use only iPhone, its not supporting any smart TV, not supporting phone operated light , in fact cant be used with other products, still have very common issue cant even set my favorite ringtone, I phone X not easy access .",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"It was my first purchase of Apple phone , I already have a Galaxy S8 from Samsung.Apart from notch at the top I have nothing to complain about this phone. Excellent build, superb software and excellent all round performance.Battery could have been a bit better for a heavy user like me, especially when my Samsung outruns this phone on a busy day.I would recommend this phone to anybody who wants to have a great smartphone up their sleeves.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,It’s great if you love the iphones.Had to watch YouTube to learn how to find functions on the phone. They need to come with basic instructions for new models like this.Still only standard ring and text tones. They need to update this feature with new sounds and more wall papers,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"One of my friends recently got the new iPhone X and we took some random photos but they all turned up amazing. The quality is outstanding. However, I do have a concern with the Face ID. WHat if you had an identical twin. In 5 seconds they could swipe you phone and look through everything. Or if you had a photograph of the owner, if you held it up to the camera, would it unlock?",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"It is beautiful phone, elegant design and I am happy with that, I always fan of apple product.Phone is fast, battery is good.i like the design , my old phone from Apple as well but with this model I can not imagine how amazing! I love this phone because the resolution is high qualityThanks Apple design iPhone X",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"It is a very expensive phone but it is definitely a great phone, it has some amazing features such as the animoji and portrait camera. The storage is absolutely amazing and it is so much easier to use face I.D. instead of fingerprints and passcodes. Without the home button it looks like it is from the future.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I find the iPhone x an excellent product which has great performance over other phones I have used. The graphics are excellent and it takes fantastic photos. The feature such as face recognition are excellent and one I particularly like is when the phone rings and it know I am looking at the phone the volume reduces automatically.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I am an Apple fan so I can be a little bias. This is only because all my other electronics work and talk together harmoniously. Face ID is good but not a real selling point. Screen resolution itself is very bright and vibrant - love the colour output it gives. Animoji is a gimmick, but fun nonetheless. Wireless charging is convenient but slow. If you're looking to upgrade but without the price tag, I'd go for an iPhone 8. I just like the X because it was the latest model!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,The apple iPhones are the best I just love them.I have 5 and 6 waiting to get the next one .The features are so easy to manage. I recommend to everyone.However I have heard that with the 10 you have to buy all the extras from iphone which I wont be getting.As all other iphones the bluetooths universal can be used so skip the 10.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I'm the first to admit that I enjoy my Apple products. My HomePod has been a wonderful addition to the house (would be better if Siri worked), and I love my MacBook Pro and iPad. There are limitations with all of them, but I'm happy with them nonetheless.With the iPhone X, the price is quite high, although let's be honest, it's not that much higher than flagship phones from some other manufacturers. If you want a cheaper phone, there will of course be other phones that will do the job for you. But if you use your phone a lot, as I do, then it can be worth paying more.Most of the changes in this phone don't make that much difference to its use. The extra screen space (without much of a bezel) is brilliant, and immediately made the old iPhone display look dated to me. The notch is... weird. I mean, why not just have a slight bezel on the top? But they made the choice. Knowing that some Android manufacturers would follow, Google has baked in notch support into the latest version of Android. It's a puzzling design decision to me, but it really doesn't get in the way very often. Occasionally in a full screen video, but not very often.Face ID is great. It works most of the time, although on occasion I find myself still having to use the pass code.Getting used to the new controls, without the home button, has taken a little bit of getting used to. Accessing control centre is done by swiping from top right, which is impossible one handed. That's a strange choice to me, too.It's fast. No lag on anything, really. And seeing apps running full screen on this thing, because of the large display, is awesome.I've heard a lot of people complaining about the price, or some of the features. If it's not for you, it's not for you, and that's OK. But if you're after a great looking phone that can do a lot of stuff very fast, has access to a lot of great apps, and you have the spare cash, go nuts.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Apple need a reality check. I wish the buying public would give it one.This phone was bought outright for me as a present. I was considering switching to Samsung who still pretend to care about their customers. Apple Australia couldn't give three-tenths of a pooh about their customers anymore.It's an okay phone. If it were half the price, I'd recommend it. But at $1700, pfft.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I love it just upgraded from an iPhone 5 and can't live without it great camera and really simple to use my wife is totally jealous and I will probably going to have to update her phone but that is the only real down side. The slim design and compact design is what really got me interested in the first place.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I waited for years to upgrade to the latest iPhone and am not disappointed. It takes a short while to adjust to the lack of a home button but once you get used to it there's no turning back. This is a very slick phone, a bit pricy but probably worth it",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,i love the slim design and ease of use with the iPhone ....as I cannot read clearly the iPhone is great as it allows me to enlarge the txt large enough for me to read without putting my reading glasses on everytime I get a message...there is enough storage for me to download heaps of apps and to take lots of phots and videos which I do frequently...the camera has a good zoom facility although the picture quality does diminish with the zoom but otherwise the pics are great quality I would like a few more editing features though.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Its incredibly fast, great design, Face ID works like a charm (even in the night...when there is less light) I personally love the camera, the quality of the photos and videos are amazing. The notch was something I wasn't a big fan of. However, its amazing how quickly I got used to it.I do wish I bought the 256GB version...with amount of 4k videos I take, the phone fills up quite fast.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,Love iphone X !! Really fast and incredible camera quality. However can sometimes crash which isn't all that well but generally is a very good product. I really like the large display and is a good change from the previous iphones.Also thhe size of this iphone was perfect for me too as I felt like the ihpone+ of other models were just a tad too big for me. I have a love-hate relationship with the side of the phone though and think they couldve improved by having perhaps gold/ rose gold as a colour option.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I love Apple product using from last 8 years.in iPhone X it’s amazing the shape.specially no buttons on front.face id function is amazing no body else can touch my phone without me.my wife try to open even she try when I was sleeping but because my eyes was closed so she couldn’t open it.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"some summary of this product- very very very very expensive- very fast- apple- OLED display ( this is very good ) , wide display- new UI- wireless charging tech.- face recognition tech.In my opinion this is not perfect and JOBs's style but it's good",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The iPhone x is a very high quality and very special to use and a lot more new features to useThis a special phone because the brand new features like face ID,animoji and much more as with all Apple it's easy to use made from delicate materials thanks for reading",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"As with all Apple phones, they are very easy to use and they are generally built with high quality materials, but also like all Apple products, the iPhone X is extremely expensive, despite all of its features, they are not really worth it for the price Apple is charging. If the phone was $200-$300 cheaper it would be significantly more worth it but I could only recommend it for people that could justify spending over $1000 on a phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,The iPhone x is a beautiful phone with the brand new face id and animoji that has been released by Apple. It also has 2 cameras for taking better photos. Thee photos I take with my iPhone x are crisp and clear! Overall this is a great product though it is quite expensive.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Great screen, excellent quality. However I believe the speed and performance could be improved a lot in the next iPhone made! I believe something can be done however apart from that the overall sveeen and no home button is amazing! More variety of colour would be good also! Overall would give 8/10",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I can’t really fault the iPhone X except for a few minor things. I bought the 256GB model, and it is excellent. Zippy, fast, responsive. The screen is beautiful, although Apple cites “edge to edge” but it really isn’t. It’s kind of full screen, but with very noticeable black bezels. Just compare it to the Samsung S8 or S9 with the curved edges. This is what I had expected Apple to do with the iPhone X, but they didn’t. Maybe they are saving it for a future release.The other issue is the beautiful screen, which unfortunately is very prone to micro abrasions. Remember the Jet Black iPhone 7? They warned us that the back might be subject to microabrasions, so we were prepared for it. They did not warn us about the screen on the iPhone X, and having used it for a few short months in my pocket which has nothing else in it, there are noticeable micro abrasions, and when I approached an Apple store staff member, they were unable to help or swap out the device. overall happy with it, but few small annoyances, which may or may not be ironed out in future releases.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Been using it since the day of the launch. It's pricey, yes, but it's a really fast phone, powerful, with amazing display. iOS is getting old for sure, but I have no complaints in a way because the apps are almost always better than the Android's.FaceID works great though it limits the way you unlock your phone on certain occasions like when you lay the iPhone on the table, or that you have to hold it facing you to unlock. Apart from these, it feels natural to unlock the phone.If you are not tied to the Apple Ecosystem, however, other flagship Android phones are great options as well as the camera can definitely compete with the iPhone X",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"This iPhone I found to be good like every iPhone although I don’t like having he facial recognition, I would’ve preferred the fingerprint like the previous model, the camera is amazing and the screen is crystal clear, phone does seem to run quicker hold charger longer and even charge quicker then previous models.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"As someone who has always been an iPhone user, I found that I wanted to try a Samsung to switch things up.

iphone,5,"Bought iPhone X - 64GB Silver as an upgrade from iPhone 7 in Dec 2017.Love it. Bigger screen size than plus version, Impressed with the dimensions, better battery life, better camera and more features. But got disappointed with the tiny scratches on the beautiful flawless stainless steel rim even with the apple genuine case with leather inlay. Its easy to get scratches on the sides - friction between tiny dust particles getting in to case and steel.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Got this phone as an upgrade from iphone 6s plus. Physically it feels like you are holding something that would shatter to a million pieces if you drop it. So you have to invest another $65 for a shock proof case. The screen resolution is good but the size is underwhelming especially the i am used to the screen size of the iphone6s plus. Camera is quite awesome. I also loved the face id feature. It is fast and works even in the dark. Performance wise it is quick and i havent experienced any lag yet.The only con is the price. Its too expensive and it should have wireless headphones and wireless chargers for the price.Buy one if you want to be up date with the trends and yoy have money to spare. If not, there are other cheaper phones that can do the same job..",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"I didn’t really like the iPhonex, I don’t know is it only me or for everyone. The battery lift is really poor. I bought it because my iPhone6+’s battery won’t last for a whole day so I bought this one but the battery lift for iPhonex is even worse than my old iPhone6+, when I checked in setting for battery usage it shows 40000+ days so I took it to apple store and checked if there is anything wrong with my iPhonexs battery they said the usage date is a bit wired but there is no problem with my battery and didn’t replace for me.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I had read other review on this phone and was a little dubious as to if I would like it. As soon as I started using the phone I loved it! Didn’t have any issues with getting used to not having a home button, love all the features and found them very easy to use. The only criticism I have is that you can’t display the battery percentage on the screen but that isn’t really a huge deal",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Apples tech just gets better with each phone, however I dislike not having a earphone home. Takes great photographs, great app storage. Sleek stylish look along wth the large screen makes perfect for playing games, taking pictures or streaming movies on Netflix. Great for all young and older generations especially with large screen making it easier to see",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Camera is great, there’s plenty of options to edit the picture. The Portrait option is the best. All of the photos I captured using this option are great.But phone is too heavy compared to other phones. Would have been better if its lightweight. Sometimes the Face Detection doesnt work as well, I have to enter the passcode.If I’ll be given a chance, I would purchase the iPhone 8+ instead of the iPhone X.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,Best phone yet! So easy to use and has everything you need. The camera quality is fantastic too. I love being able to have a great camera on my phone rather than having to purchase a camera as well. The phone is super slim and lightweight as well! Love it!,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I love the iPhone X.. Incredible display, incredible sound, incredible long battery life.. I can actually get through the day now with my battery. IF ever I have used my phone that much, I actually use the battery throughout the day, the quick charge, allows the battery to very quickly charge to 50% if anyone is looking at a phone, I highly recommend this one.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Expensive phone - but stunning design, beautiful display and fast processor.Touch screen is a breeze to use, much more sensitive than the previous models, the Face ID works well however sometimes during cold or hot weather extra protective clothing - it struggles to recognise my face.Without a physical 'home' button using the phone seems more immersive - however there are still many apps out there that require the home button - it becomes annoying as you have to 'make it appear' each time you need to use it.Will recommend to others who are willing to pay for the high price!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"When the iPhone X was announced, I knew I had to have it.A lot of people have criticised Apple for copying Samsung’s Galaxy 8 with its next to nothing bezel but Apples iPhone X’s screen takes the cake. There is pretty much no bezel, meaning the the screen is displayed edge to edge (besides the “notch” at the top where the camera and receiver is located).I bought this phone on launch and have received a few malfunctions here and there. A few given examples were sometimes viewing a website in Safari, the search bar would move higher up to the phone (where the time and signal bar is) and you’ll need to force quit the program to rectify the problem. It’s not a common occurrence, which is fortunate.iPhone users will know the iPhone has a function where their battery displays a “percentage” of the battery life and a better understanding on how long before they should commence charging. iPhone X “does” have this feature but it’s not constantly shown on screen. A simple swipe from top to bottom of the screen would drag down a taskbar which will then display this percentage. Not really an ideal move for me but I can understand why this needed to be done as there is no space for it to be displayed on the top right corner.Minor problems aside, I took this phone with me to Japan for my honeymoon and I took quite a few photos. I was never good at taking photos but I gave my phone to someone who was in the same tour as I was and he took a photo of me and my wife. Apparently, there is a portrait option which focuses on the subject and blurs out the background.If the phone is being used for a lengthy time, the back starts warming up. I’m assuming this is a normal occurrence.Now, a new feature on the iPhone X which the previous models never had is the face ID. This replaces the old fingerprint scanner as the iPhone X obviously doesn’t have the famous home button. The success rate for the phone to detect my face is 99.8% of the time. The face ID will also detect in pitch black as I always use the phone before I go to bed. Most of the time it does not detect in the morning, most likely because I just woken up and my face is still in the tired state.If for any reason, face ID does not detect you, then you have a backup 6 digit pin that you input.The face ID also have the moving emoticons. These can be used for messaging your friend instead of the traditional texting. It detects most facial movements, winking, moving your mouth etc. it records your voice as well. Although, older iPhone models do not have access to this feature, they can still view it.These are just some of the small selection of features and minor issues with the phone but all in all, it’s a great phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I love this phone so much. It is so great and so easy to use. The camera takes stunning photos! I have always supported Apple products ever since I had owned my first iPhone 3. I have not had any bad experience with my iPhone X and do recommend, especially is you love to take great quality photos",Productreview.com.au
iphone,1,I purchase I phone X after last iphone i used iphone 5s.I left iphone because android is too advance than ios.because of all marketing and crazy people i brought iphone x 256gb.I don't like it at all compare to android. Most of the feather was already used in android and they are much better.Not recommended specially for the price. Going to sell and buying samsung galaxy s9.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Face ID works almost every time. Fast CPU and I had used both Pixel 2 and Samsung Note 8. I will prefer X any day of the week. The only issue is few Apps require home Button it is a bit annoying to use it.  The camera is excellent and sound quality is the best.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"It's a great iPhone iteration, with bigger screen space and Face ID. I don't miss the home button and I didn't like Touch ID, I actually find Face ID much more reliable, a glance is enough to unlock my phone or take a look at recent notifications. Display notch is actually not irritating, but a distinctive feature which many other phones now try to copy. Great performance, nice camera and I love wireless charging.I have to say though, Apple is really testing our wallets with iPhone X prices.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Love Apple products, the way they are streamless, integrated and look good. But this version of the iPhone I feel is trying too hard. I’m not a fan of the face recognition, it doesn’t work in dimlit areas or if someone else wants to look at phone they have to repeatedly put in passcode (whereas iPhone 8 could save their finger print). It feels heavier and not as conveniently sized as the iPhone 6 upwards. Still a good product but with dramatic differences which are difficult to adapt to.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"As an iPhone fan since iPhone 4 release, I love the IPhone X with the full screen, metal frame  and a glass back. The phone looks elegant. I feel like holding a real phone, unlike other phones which are like toys. Love the Face ID function that makes login so easy. There are more to list for this excellent phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Feeling very underwhelmed. Great for the bigger screen in a smaller phone than the plus, however the loss of the home button is very frustrating. Facial recognition is hit and miss and required you to be actually looking at your phone which means unlocking the phone is delayed. I miss the home button where the finger print meant, the phone was unlocked before you even looked at the screen. The ani-emoji now aren’t even special with apps that can do the same.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Just love this iPhone X, it’s so amazing with its fancy features. Love the face reaconition feature, it’s so handy as you don’t have to remember your passwords.  The Huge Screen is excellent for playing games and watching movies when you need to pass time on the train. The camera is awesome and takes brilliant pictures. I would recommend this product to anyone and I also had the best service from Myers Melbourne.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Initially I was reluctant about the iPhone X but after using it I would say its the smoothest phone I have ever used. Don't missed the hone button at all, except for touch ID which was much better. Face ID sometimes doesn't work in dark conditions and it can get annoying, hopefully they will fix in the next generation.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I've skipped out on the last couple of iPhones since there didn't seem to be much difference in hardware, but I'm glad Apple changed the iPhone X up. The screen is huge, without a border taking up space and really the perfect size for my tiny hands. I love the facial recognition and the camera quality is excellent. Very useful and fast but most importantly, the battery life is quite extensive for an iPhone. Definitely the best iPhone I've ever owned.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone X. The big screen is such a huge difference. It is easy to use, and excellent for games. Face ID is a game changer. Whether if i'm in low light or in the peak of day, Face ID can still recognize me. Amazing! Must buy for any phone user.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I have had the iPhone X since it’s release and I am so pleased with it, Apple has really outdone themselves! The Face ID feature which replaces Touch ID is almost infallible, so I’m unsure why people seem to have an issue with it.The phones design and the material used in construction is of the best quality and you can really tell when holding the device in your hand. Apple is known for quality hardware and they have not disappointed in this iteration of their flagship mobile phone.One tip though, I bought the 256GB version but if you don’t use the camera so much, maybe stick with the 64GB. With iCloud backup and image file compression built into the iPhone, you will probably get away with the 64GB. I have used 42GB so far and I consider myself a power user with lots of apps and images.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"If you want a phone that will turn heads then this is it. If you want a phone that has a beautiful then this is it. Great camera, Beautiful display but I still miss the headphone pack. I own 5 pairs of $200 - $500 headphones that I can't use with this phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The Apple iPhone X is a great phone, the X is new and innovative. Let's start with the camera. It is breath taking and brilliant. I have owned an S7 and it beats the by a mile. There are added effects to make it look like a DSLR camera. Only sometimes would the fuzzy blurring not full capture the main focus of the image. The phone is quick and sharp. What you would expect from an iPhone. The specs are good, but as apple make iOs it is that much amplified. The face id is fast even though I prefer touch Id. The only little annoyance is the notch, but once you get past that you have a beautiful phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Really nice phone, impressed with faceID. Battery is good but could be better. Overall beast phone. Would I recommend? If you can afford, go for it. iPhone 8's are just as good in my opinion. I've experienced minor lags once a while, a quick update fixed it. 10/10 Love it",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"I've had every version of the iPhone and although the X is great, its not worth the $$$ compared to an iPhone 6 Plus.Had my iPhone 6 Plus not have vanished recently, I think it would have done me for another 5 years at least.Save your $$$ and wait for some real improvements !.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Great phone, some big changes to get used to compared to the old iPhones. The gesture controls are cool to use. Only thing I hope they change is not being able to use the hover button to shut down the X. Oh, and a couple of dollars cheaper would’ve been great too. ;) LOL",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The edge to edge screen is amazing, with OLED you can really see the difference compared to the older iPhones. The best feature would have to be the camera, shooting in portrait mode produces beautiful photos and the 4K video is crystal clear. Highly recommend this phone to suit anyone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I have been a long time user of Iphone, from the first one. I was still using my 4 year old Iphone 6 plus and was very happy with it and initially a bit reluctant to pay the price for the X, I was also considering switching to Samsung. Eventually went for the Iphone X and I am super happy with it, it really exceeds what I was expecting. Everything feels faster, more clever. There is nothing 'very' new about this versus older models, but everytyhing just feels better: screen quality, switching between apps, and a lot of smaller new features that I personnally find very cool. I initially was not convinced with the 'new' headphone format (no classic headphone jack(, whereby you are forced to go wireless or to use their small adaptor, but it works ok and I dont see if as a major negative in the end, just need to get use to it. I also noticed people complained about the 'no home button', but I think it is actually great and feels like a very well integrated device.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Got the iphone x for christmas. My last phone eas an iphone se bought in 2016. I was happy with my SE because of the compact size and didnt want a larger phone. However, I am hooked on my iphone x. It’s larger, yet sleek and handy. Gets a bit warm when charging, but haven’t noticed any problems. Love it!",Productreview.com.au

Decided to buy this albeit expensive and very happy with the built quality of the phone. Love the new screen, it is very sharp and clear. I missed the touch ID at first but I can live without it now. I still feel we need card reader so I hope they will get a card reader slot for the next iPhone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Face ID is excellent.  It works perfectly. I had read so many negative reports about it which made me uncertain about the purchase.  But I went ahead and bought one.  I am so please I did.  The most important reason for my purchase is that Touch ID will be so outdated by September this year.  I have 256 GB because I also feel with new technology constantly evolving I will need loads of space. Why I upgraded to a X from 5s 32GB, apart from its’ sluggishness, was the lack of GB.   I am thrilled with my X.  And it did not take long to get used to the great new features.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Very happy with the iPhone X, it’s the perfect size and big screen due to the edge to edge display.The oled display is truly stunning and screen resolution is the best out there I believe.However Face ID is definitely not as fast and reliable as Touch ID, and truly miss not having Touch ID. Only reason I’d consider the iPhone 8 over the iPhone X is to retain the Touch ID.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,3,"As usual, Apple comes up with a reliable product. However after using it for a few months I have to say, it falls short of my expectations. The screen is definitely too small and I need to charge the phone every day, just like previous models. I thought the screen is a lot more resistant and it's not, it scratches and I had to buy screen protector. I still find myself using iPhone 6 Plus quite often to watch movies and for a bigger screen real estate. Not having to deal with home button is FANTASTIC!!! They should've done it ages ago. Now...the wireless charging. First of all, it takes ages to charge the phone wirelessly. So the technology is not there yet in terms of going all wireless. I still use wired earphones and wired charging. Files, media transfer over iTunes is a lot faster compared to older models. Camera is a bit better, but not wow. It's ok, incremental evolution - nothing more nothing less. I hope this year model will have bigger screen and better faster wireless.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,The size becomes smaller but the screen is larger the before!I really love the feeling when I have it on my hand!I can say Iphone X is the best cellphone in the current market. It introduces new gestures which is quite convenient and the system is very fast!Highly recommended!,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I have always had iPhones and the iPhone X is by far my favorite. The camera on this phone is incredible and I love the fact that I can use face ID as well as touch ID. Wireless charging is so easy and convenient and the storage and battery life is insane. The only con to this phone is that it is a lot heavier than others and is easy to crack. Overall I am very happy and would recommend this phone.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The iPhone X is a pretty good phone in my opinion and i have had a few phones. The display is excellent and according to some review and specs it is not as good as the Google Pixel 2 XL. I would disagree, I have had both phones and the display is brighter, more crisp and supports HDR and Dolby Vision which for some reason the Google does not (big let down there folks). The processor is the fastest I have used. The only problem I have had is drop out of blue tooth connection when playing audio. Perhaps a firmware can fix this problem. Ofcourse the other problem is the top of the display and the bezel taking some of the display space for the camera, not sure why they didnt try a little harder to get rid of it, definitely noticeable.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"The apple iPhone x looks flash and trendy however functionality is really annoying especially with unlocking with face ID. The phone is easy to crack and is heavy also and the notch on the display is fairly annoying as it's a little black hole resting on the top of your phone. Your better off with an iPhone 8 plus model which is much more user friendly. Having said this, the phone is still powerful enough and useful for what you need to do for everyday tasks.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I have always had Sumsung but after going to Frankston Telstra speaking with them about the concerns i had with my mobile they started to explain the options i had explaining what the iphone can do and also with the iphone clasic watch i was so impressed Jason was amazing and very helpful,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I moved from android to apple about two years ago, and for someone who is a bit of a tech nerd, the X was a no-brainer. I was initially a little put off by the design, but after a couple of hours use, the notch is not even noticable. In fact, I personally rather like that the whole top of the screen isn't taken up by a status bar!The hardware is solid; FaceID works really well, and both front and rear cameras are excellent. I do find the screen picks up very light scratches incredibly easily; I've not dropped it once in the last four months, but I have a large number of glittering shallow scratches. I would recommend having a screen protector for this phone!That aside though, I do really like this phone. It is attractive and feels great to use.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I’ve been using an I iPhone since the 3 and must say I was quite excited with the prospect of the X.Was it worth the wait? Worth the upgrade?I’d say yes but the change hasn’t been as drastic as I’d initially hoped. The phone is notably faster than my iPhone 7 and the screen size upgrade was always going to be a positive in my books but the slight instability and some bugginess does taint the experience a bit. Most annoyingly, the camera quite often freezes whilst the app is active and needs to be exited and restarted to work again.The biggest difference (of course) is the removal of the home button. I thought it would take a while to get used to the absence of a physical button to navigate through the phone but behold, it only took a few days for the gestures to become second nature.Overall, nothing too surprising from Apple.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,The iPhone needs no introduction although perhaps the X does. It's apple's first foray into an OLED screen with no home button and they do a nice job.Having come from a plus size iphone previously it took some time to adjust to the smaller phone. Even several months after release I'm still finding I am making typing errors using the on screen keyboard. I would love a bigger version of this phone.The other issue is something I noticed that started with the 6s+. The screen is quite prone to micro scratching from unknown sources - it's not like it's sharing a pocket with anything else.The screen is simply fantastic and the camera takes amazing photos.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The best phone I have purchased ever. This iPhone was bought for my family. They really enjoy the iPhone and advise that the iPhone has a modern design and works excellent.

iphone,5,"It is quite expensive so I was hesitating to get it at first. The built is very nice and decent, love the big screen and the camera.

Battery life is decent.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The iPhone X is a real joy to use. It’s beautiful, the software works perfectly in harmony with the hardware and did I say it’s beautiful? The problem is that it is also the most fragile piece of technology I’ve ever owned. It took less than a day for the glass back to shatter. Less than two weeks until the front was split in half.

Cellular and WIFI speeds are quick, and the dual lens camera gives out crisp and colour-accurate photos.

The A11 chip is excellent - multitasking with various apps, emails and messages is an absolute breeze. This phone is a true pleasure to use. Apple have truly outdone themselves.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I upgraded from a iphone 8 64gb it is quite a nice step up in performance and screen size notch isn't that noticeable phone is however overpriced for what it is.

iphone,4,"As an iPhone 3GS user, since it will always use apple fruit powder, if it is not Samsung's bombing survivors, s8 listed, I am afraid to switch to Andrews camp, the idea of ​​millet mix2 listed a step further. Even after the Apple conference is over - iPhone X did not bring me any surprises, cancellation of the fingerprint is even canceled I once canceled the idea of ​​buying. After getting the real machine, there is only one idea in my mind, that is the value. iPhone X Color value is really tall. First of all, lock screen state, has been criticized by the bangs is not seen. I bought a dark gray, covered with glass backplane whole body seamless, do not worry about the paint off, Shu oil coating also inhibits the use of fingerprint retention. Apple iPhone hidden antenna 7, this is disappearing without a trace. After unlocking the picture to tell the truth I did not think so ugly, Liu Hai first look really not used to, but not very compelling, taking into account the technical constraints, do not cancel the front camera and photoreceptor case, this Seems the only solution.iPhone X took a lot of weight in the hands, the official release of the weight of 174g, weighs 30g more than the iPhone 7, weighs nearly 40g heavier than the iPhone 6, it seems that much more, but the actual use of the gap is still quite obvious. Streaking case, iPhone X significantly more in line with my sense of grip on the phone needs. Of course, iPhone X is not without its drawbacks. One thing I most want to say is that the iPhone X rear lens projection is too high tmd, almost double the iPhone 6. iPhone X glass backplane and full screen price is not low, compared to the older models are also more likely to be more bad, do not buy Care + without a protective case, the machine does have some burning hands. Color accuracy brought by the OLED screen In fact, the visual recognition gap is small, but the screen may have to say is a hidden danger.Accessories are also quite worth mentioning the issue, iPhone 7 launched by numerous people Tucao wireless headset does not seem to make Apple turn around. iPhone X support fast charging and wireless charging, but want to achieve the best charging speed, the need to purchase a separate USB-C power adapter + USB-C to lightning cable, the official website price of nearly 800rmb, wireless charging base also need 500rmb This price is the recommended third-party equipment prices, Apple's own upcoming charging board, the price probably only high not low). In contrast, wireless headphones that do not involve the core features seem less objectionable. Also do not know if it is my illusion, there is no antenna iPhone X signal seems a lot worse, glass backplane there is also a little fever problem. It seems that you want to have both Yan value and function, Apple probably still have some way to go.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I wasn’t even looking at buying a new iPhone but when this was released and the reviews started to come out I just had to. It took me a little while to find stock but when I got it I was mind blown.Just a super fast smartphone with great features.The facial recognition works great. The camera is superb. It now has wireless charging too (We gonna look back in the past and think cables were so primitive). Just love everything Apple is doing with those phones. The only downside is the price really, but if you look at it, most people spend A LOT of their time on their smartphones, so you’re spending for something you will use a lot, therefore I never regret spending this money outright.I highly recommend the iPhone X.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I love my iPhone X, but I would be lying if I said there weren’t issues. FaceID is terrible, no matter what anyone says. Yes, it’s fast, it’s perfect, in ideal conditions. The reality is, we are ALWAYS using the phone in other conditions. Glancing from across the table, quickly checking something down at our pocket, or curled over on a pillow in bed - the iPhone X will be unforgiving if you don’t hold it up nicely. So get used to using a passcode again. The notch is fine, I must admit - it hides away nicely in apps where it would be jarring (ie video) but it’s there showing your stats in simple apps like web browser where it doesn’t matter. The screen is long so you’re never focusing on the edges anyway when you’re say, reading. Other than those features, it’s an iPhone - if you’ve used one of the old ones, you already know the experience. One note tho: it’s quite heavy if you’re not used to a “plus” model.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"For the iphoneX, they added Face ID and higher resolution for cameras. that's really cool. However i still prefer the fingerprint ID as if you have your phone next to you on the table you cannot just reach out and unlock it like you can with fingerprint ID.

iphone,5,"Hats off to the engineering team at apple; the features they have introduced was completely unheard off before. Simple things like lowering the ringer substantially when you looking at screen - no one before Apple thought of this.Messaging with invisible ink (both parties on iphone X), animoji is cool.

iphone,4,"I am surprised to see such a high price on this phone. Not sure why people would over pay. My brothers and I began buying and upgraded to the latest iPhone since the very first version and the iPhone X is one the biggest changes that I can remember. Much like going from the iPhone 3GS to the 4 was or the iPhone 5 to the 6.The X model looses the Home Button and doesn’t have a the headphone jack like the 7’s. No big deal on the headphone jack. Sometimes I do prefer plugging a set in and not having to worry about Bluetooth.The lack of a Home button does take some time getting use too. It is really different with the swipe gestures but after a day or so you get use to it. Basically learning a new way to switch and X out of apps. I like it now after using it.The phone is fast, feels crisper than the 7. Safari is snappier and pretty much all the apps are.The phones size is somewhat like the 7, feels thinner but is a tad larger.If you can afford it, you will be happy. I played with the iPhone 8 and it feels quicker too.",Productreview.com.au

It is tough to hold this phone during long calls.Moreover, this phone had been a premium phone with premium pricing.

The display is immaculate and the camera is simply on another level.

If it were narrower I might be able to live with the fact that part of the screen is no display, but it is so wide, that it blocks your view in a lot of situations such as viewing a photo full screen, is just unacceptable.The camera is awesome. It's been rated the best phone camera for stills and it deserves it.A bit heavy and too thick, especially with case on, but acceptable.New gesture operation takes getting used to, works better in some scenarios but not as good in others (have to wait rather than almost instant response).",Productreview.com.au

Battery life is fantastic, the screen is great to view (there is slight blueish tone when viewed from an angle, however), the camera is fast and crisp, it's fast and snappy to use and looks great. It's everything good about an iPhone.The not so good… the glass back is a fingerprint magnet, the stainless steel band is too and looks like it will mark easily, and it still uses the Lightning connector rather than USB-C.Side-note: the notch isn't an issue and I actually sort of like it after using the phone for some time. Don't let it influence your decision.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,4,"The good bits: The iPhone X is easy to use, better to hold than my previous 6S Plus. Face ID works well (most of the time, it's quick to deny login if you've just woken up and haven't got both your eyes open...) Sound from the phone's speaker is loud and clear as well.The not-so-good bits: Apple Pay could be streamlined to use Face ID to pay rather than using passcode - which is pretty much the same as entering your PIN into the EFTPOS machine anyway. Accessing the torch and the swipe down menu from the lock screen is hit-and-miss, sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't - hopefully just a bug with iOS that will be ironed out.",Productreview.com.au

It takes clear shot photos and it looks very professional, by far one of the best cameras for taking photos.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I've had every single iPhone since it launched and the iphone X has been revolutionary for me. I've always admired the Samsung but not Android so to get the edge to edge screen with the Apple iPhone is UNREAL. My finger print recognition in the iPhone 7 was so hit and miss whereas the facial recognition on the X is almost flawless. Great for opening all those apps that used to require fingerprint access. Worth every cent when you consider how often you use your phone. Just do it !!,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I won't lie - the iPhone X comes at a hefty price; and you probably pay extra given it's the anniversary edition - I expect future models to come back down in price to compete with flagship models from other companies. Neverthless, there is no doubt that this is a well built phone - and it works.The build quality is superior. The combination of metal and glass feels premium. Although I recently damaged my phone, I can say that the cost of repair ($799 AUD) is ludicrous. Apparently, the design is such that any damage that exceeds ""screen only"" cannot be repaired and requires a full replacement... This is clearly a flaw. I luckily had it covered on insurance, but would recommend Apple Care if such an insurance policy is unattainable.The camera is breathtaking. It's incredible to see how far phone cameras have come, and the portrait mode works a charm - so much so that I now take all the photos for my workplace's social media (hospitality industry). Furthermore, it works well in low light, and the OIS helps with blur - especially for video.It is fast enough that I never notice it being slow, and the battery life is decent if you are careful with it. I usually have a powerbank on me so do not really think about it. The wireless charging is useful too - but the back of the phone can get quite hot when in heavy use or wirelessly charging. Luckily, it won't blow up.Finally, the display is the best iPhone display yet - the colours are pixel density is amazing. And the Face ID works a charm too.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,I purchased an iPhone X a month ago from Apple store. I was very excited about it in the beginning but it’s nothing so special about it. It has good camera and bigger screen compared to previous models but didn’t impress me very much. It also has facial recognition which is super cool. It is good but not fantastic.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I was due for an upgrade coming from a much older iPhone and was tossing up between the iPhone 8 or X. I went with the X for a few reasons,- Extra 1gb of RAM- Longer battery life- Better screenAfter using this device every day since I got it the day it came out, it has been great. Very fast and snappy and a thorough pleasure to use. The edge-to-edge screen is a nice touch and front camera and sensors aren't that intrusive and you easily forget they are there after some time.  However, the one annoyance with this device would have to be the face ID feature. It is simply inconsistent unless you are starring at your phone which is not always possible in all cases (e.g. if you wanna check your phone while it's laying on the table). I really do miss the ease of touch ID and hope Apple finds a way to implement it in the next iPhone. The other aspects of the phone are great and are what you would expect of using an iPhone with great and easy software design, quality materials used and great support. It is slightly over priced but if you can get it now for a bit cheaper it is worth it especially coming from a very old iPhone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"With the removal of the home button, the iPhone X represents possibly the biggest transformation of the iPhone to date. Fluid gestures have been introduced to allow smooth navigation of the phone, rendering the home button an ancient relic of the past.Touch ID has been replaced with the new Face ID and I can honestly say it has improved the overall experience. Authentication for apps and Apple Pay seems seamless, making the same authentication with Touch ID seem quite fragmented.The OLED display stretching to accommodate the entire phone really is a work of art with brilliant contrast and accurate colours. The dual camera on the back captures sharp and impressive images, and combined with Live Photos, more readily captures memories and experiences.Few minor issues - iOS 11 remains not without bugs which can sometimes hamper the overall experience and you might struggle with Face ID to unlock your phone if it's lying flat on a desk.Overall, the iPhone upgrade I had been waiting for.

Here are my top reasons: screen size (bigger than plus but phone is smaller than the plus) and camera quality is insane (I even took some work professional photos with it). Minor Drawback: Face ID - I had to get my phone replaced, as there were hardware problem, but Apple was happy to exchange it to a new one.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,Upgraded from the iPhone 6 so to me there are significant improvements such as the camera quality.The speed and response times are excellent and overall it is a pleasant phone to use.It took some time to get used to the facial recognition instead of fingerprint recognition and the absence of the home button but the facial recognition works really well.Few things I am still getting used to are how to clear the background running apps and also i keep accidentally taking screenshots as you now use the volume and lock button to take screenshots but for some reason the positioning of these buttons always means i take accidental screenshots.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Coming from an iPhone 6, the X feels like a breath of fresh air. Great speed and responsiveness in most apps. The OLED screen looks great (although some apps haven't updated to use the full screen).There are some of the more controversial features which I feel are a bit half-baked such as face ID and the notch on the top of the screen. Face ID seems like a compromise as they couldn't get the on-screen touch ID working. I much preferred touch ID as you're not always holding the phone in front of you when you want to unlock it (phone on table). The notch as well takes a bit of getting used to visually and if you are using a screen protector like me means that the screen protectors don't adequately cover the area and make it look obvious that you are using a screen protector.Being the most expensive phone on the market (not counting Vertu and other exotics), I would have expected more rather than just a luke-warm experience.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I really enjoy using this phone! I wouldn't necessarily recommend purchasing it if you own models 6 and onwards tho, as the differences arnt worth the hefty price tag.

iphone,4,"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made.

As far as face ID it works great. People really need to stop slamming this feature. There is always the option of passcode if I prefer . However, I still feel silly and awkward using apple pay. Touch ID seemed more user friendly but it’s a small sacrifice.  as far as the screen it doesn’t seem as big as the iPhone 7+ and the actual phone seems heavier and felt easier to use in this respect. However I have big man hands. I imagine that this is something to get used to. And as far as the ‘notch at the top’, People Please! I Don’t ever notice it. People will troll on anything these days. Do you look at your hands when you hold the Phone? No. However, I still do miss my iPhone 7+ as far as screen and ‘watchability’ but I love the speed and dependability of the iPhone X. The GB aren’t an issue as I have cloud storage everywhere.Defentily a good phoneBrief Cons-COST and battery!!!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The highlight isn’t the screen, it’s the battery life! 64 gb memory is actually pretty decent, I barely use half of it. The screen is also perfect with the perfect sized phone. The only thing (well two) is that I do miss the button and fingerprint scanner, my face does not work at all times.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,2,My mom slipped her iPhone X from the chair and the screen cracked instantly. To repair we had to pay amazing 500AUD just for the screen replacement...  Make sure to get very good screen guard otherwise it might happen to you as well. Also it does not have fingerprint which is very not comfortable.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"With Iphone X, I am so excited the new full-screen and face ID features.  An excellent camera and cutting-edge face-scanning technology. Compared with Iphone6, the mobile phone runs faster, doesn't wait, and saves a lot of time. Another amazing feature is Animoji, you can record the live emoji of your expression.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Great Iphone with the face id being slightly more inconveniencing than touch id, such as unable to be upside down or sideways. Large screen, the notch does not bother me at all unless apps bleed up, thinking its all available space, otherwise i just think of it as a bit of extra screen to show time and date and carrier, although not having a numbered percentage annoys me, overall not bad phone otherwise expensive.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"While it is pricey, iPhone X makes it up by the classy design and snappy OS.The camera has been ramped up and there is a portrait mode, where you can take pictures with studio lightings and free bokeh effect straight from the camera. I got the 64GB version, but probably should have got the 256GB one.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"At least some improvements have been made in appearance than in the previous generations. The screen is bigger and the fuselage is smaller. It's waterproof, but it's out of touch in the water screen. It seems just to make the phone waterproof from a security point of view, not for underwater use. The use of new phones is not smooth, and there's a bigger memory single effect than it used to be.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Okay, so I do love Apple products, and this is really no exception.  Yes, it's expensive, and they are purely pricing it that way frankly because they can. Having said that it's a great phone, one of my favourite features is Face ID and least liked features is Face ID. Let me explain: Face ID is great when you're actively using the phone, e.g. holding it to unlock, signing into web sites 'just happens' as you're already looking at the phone and it scans your face and poof you're looking at your bank account details without blinking.  The downside is that if you have your phone on your desk or table and want to unlock it you can't because the camera / sensor at the top of the phone has to be directly looking at your face - where as with TouchID you could have the device lying flat and unlock it anywhere within fingers reach.  Seems like a small issue, but it does get annoying / requires a change in behaviour.  The additional features such as portrait and Animoji are magical. And the screen size is great, it has a screen as large as a ""Plus"" model, but the form factor of a regular model.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This phone is the complete deal. From it’s amazing screen size to its fins too sloth and compactness. This phone is suited for the everyday person or someone requiring up and beyond. Whether you are a student or the chief executive officer of a multi national company, this phone has it all.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I'm very impressed with the X. I was a bit. hesitant to upgrade as the reviews were kind of ""meh"" and it is pricey. It takes about two weeks to get fully used to the gestures and face unlock but then there's no going back. It really feels like the future. The OLED screen is just perfect and it feels really special to use",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Upgraded my iPhone 6s to iPhone X recently. Have to say that it is as good as it gets. The Face ID is revolutionary, works very quickly, sometimes even when you don’t really want to unlock your phone! However i still prefer the fingerprint ID as if you have your phone next to you on the table you cannot just reach out and unlock it like you can with fingerprint ID. That is the only negative, otherwise an excellent product.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I have had many iPhones in the past but this iPhone X is just so much better. The screen quality is really crisp and sharp. The main thing i love about this phone is the camera, especially portrait mode, it just makes the photo look so professional. Another good thing about this phone is the new Face ID feature which makes home button completely useless, it is so much easier to use your phone like this.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I upgraded from a iPhone 6 plus. The performance increase is night and day. Very fast and snappy, the removal of the home button resulted in an interface that very intuitive and the edge to edge screen is very nice. I can easily recommend this phone and don't think I would want to upgrade for at lease another few years.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Very good phone, face-id works great. The OLED screen is very good quality. The screen is now the perfect size and good for watching movies and reading PDF files. Wireless charging works great and can be left charging overnight and don't need to worry about charging cables. Overall highly recommended product.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"It is quite expensive. I do not think it is really worth its price. The screen is not big enough. I need set up the lettlers in very big vision. The battery perfermance is bad, it should better than previous iPhones but it is not.If I can choose again, I will not buy it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"My background: I've been an Apple user since the iPhone 3. I upgrade to the latest iPhone on average every 2 years with my last one the 6s PlusPros- Excellent OLED screen. I'm consistently impressed by the image quality when i look at my phone, especially how black the blacks are. This is surprisingly the most notable upgrade- FaceID is easy to use and works well under many conditions- Removal of the home button is definitely the right direction for the design language of iPhone. The replacement swipe actions are very intuitive and there is barely any learning curve. I easily got used to it within a few minutes. The home button just feels old school now.Meh- The notch is a bit strange or not impressively useful but not a deal breaker. Didn't notice it was there for a while- iOS is iOS. If you're not a fan of the operating system, this phone isn't going to convert you.Cons- Expensive! Not the best value phone by a mile, but I'm invested in the Apple ecosystem now",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Using my iPhone X for several months now and I’m loving it. The screen quality is very crisp and sharp, the overall size of the phone is handy and comfortable to use compared to the size of iPhone Plus models. The camera quality is a great step up from the older iPhone models and I must say it is very comparable to a entry level DSLR cameras.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"5.8 inch screen bigger than the Plus version, but because it is a full version of the design, so the real machine is relatively small, and it is much smaller, can hand operation, the following comparison chart for readers reference is attached. But no physical Home button after operation are all changing gestures, originally I want to say should become very complex and not too comfortable, but after a few times with down, have to say is very good to fit in and better than before",Productreview.com.au

It takes stunning pictures in low light and portrait mode.The phone is a good size and weight, it is beautiful and sleek.I did miss having a home button but have forgotten all about it!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Let me remember iPhone 5. iPhone X has whole screen on the front face. The size of screen is equal to iPhone 7 plus. But, in fact, during my using, the screen is just like iPhone 7 or 8. The top and bottom of screen is just wasted when u play game. And it does not suit for people who has big hands. But I have to say the design is beautiful. And don't forget, do not buy any iPhones less than 128gb, or ur everyday job is delete, delete and delete.Overall, I return to my iPhone 7 plus. And I'm waiting for the next generation.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I get why people think it's too small, but coming from a samsung galaxy, I like that it fits in my pocket. I do find the screen is a bit too fragile as the edges go further out but the screen is prettier. I like the face id better than the fingerprint ID but it is a bit iffy when I wake up. I wouldn't say it's better or worse than previous iphones, it's just smaller and has a better battery life.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Generally iphone X is excellent. But sometimes when I watching movie and charging at the same time, phone will become too hot. Really worry if battery life will reduce if this things happen. Without home button is pretty cool anyway. In fact after I changing Iphone X , realize home button is really useless.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The face id is a little bit not as convenient as fingerprint ID but it is cool and high-tech. So I really like the feeling when unlocking it with just simply looking at it. The screen is more narrow than my previous iphone 6 plus so a little bit not happy. Apart from above all this, the phone is nice to use and always fast.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Amazing user experience! I do like the new all-screen display (not such all screen as there is a notch). The touch screen is very responsive and the new OLED screen looks amazing. Better than any other iPhone available on the market. Face ID could be improved a bit with speed, but overall it is very fast. I upgraded from an iPhone 6 and noticed a very big difference.The only issue with this is that the iPhone X sometimes gets really, really laggy.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Forgot the people who say that Apple users are all about show and hype. This product is amazing and worth every penny.The camera is better than a DSLR, the phone is lightning fast and no home button means things are just better and more efficient. You will get used to it in no time. Great size phone, fits in the hand perfectly.Would say go buy one as soon as you can, its the best phone in the history of mankind",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"After using it for 2 months, I am disappointed in the sense that as someone mentioned, not all apps supports the full screen. In fact, for apps that does not support the full screen, the screen size displayed ends up being smaller than iPhone 8+. Now, don't get me wrong, the phone itself is fast with no lag. In fact, all Apple Phones on release has no lag. After a few years, when the apps start demanding more power, then the lag will appear.I also hate the fact that there is that darn home line below the screen. Maybe I am dumb, but not being able to disable it has affected my game player as it is annoyingly there.In the end, I seriously thinks that iPhone 8+ would have been a better choice for me.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,iPhone X is the greatest iPhone that Apple has ever made. The gesture control is leading for another 5 years at least. Cannot really go back to any phones with home buttons even those old iPhones. Android devices got into trouble this time with this beast. definitely will buy next iPhone.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,it is fast...but apparently the camera doesn’t always work well... at least I can say my mom’s Huawei camera is better than my X...and one more thing...I still miss home button and I don’t know why they don’t use this button any more...one thing that makes me happy is the face recognition system,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I can’t say how pleased I am with the X. All the negative press was absolute rubbish. It works a treat! No issues and the battery life compared to earlier models is brilliant! Facial recognition software rarely fails. I do miss the home button but easily adjusted to life without it. The speakers are crystal clear. Only thing that could possibly tarnish it is the lack of a headphone jack. Now you need to use the charge port for headphones, meaning no charge and jam :/",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"If you are in the Apple system, then you normally get the latest iPhone every year or every two years. IPhone X being the latest and most exciting iPhone, has significant new features that many find exciting about, including Face ID, which only comes in iPhone X currently, and is indeed time-saving and easy-to-use in most cases. It, however,  becomes less desired than Touch ID when using Apple Pay as when putting your iPhone X close enough for an efpos machine to read, you have to somehow make your face close enough for your phone to recognise you. The full screen can been seen on many other phones released recently as well but iPhone X gives you the best screen ratio and thus the small form factor, very preferable for some. Better cameras front and rear and faster cpu and gpu than almost all other phones on the market. Whether that justifies the price tag is up to individuals. If you like bigger screens, wait for the next gen iPhones.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"A great phone but at it's price point, honestly expected more. Feels like it's production was rushed and a unfinished buggy product was released to generate media attention. The facial recognition at times is quite buggy and to be honest the whole Animoji gimmick get's old fast. However like all other iPhones, it does run exceptionally well.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The screen is the first thing you notice, it is just beautiful with the edge to edge design. The camera is the best I've ever used and the touch screen is responsive and there is no lag whatsoever. It is an expensive investment but I expect to get at least 3 years out of it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,This phone is very impressive - as you would expect for their flagship model. The face ID is a great change and very useful compared to touch ID. The photo quality is great and the screen size is a nice intermediate between the traditional iphone and iphone plus models. The OLED screen makes everything look very crisp and the glass back makes it feel very sleek. I love my iphone x!,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I switched back to Apple from my Samsung S6 mainly due to the IOS as it works better with my other macbook and ipad. Loving this phone so far, battery lasts all day, I find myself with just under 50% battery at the end of the day, so I charge it at night while I sleep. Face recognition does it job but I have one minor issue is that for the face recognition to see you you need to be looking at the phone from the correct angle, often I have my phone laying flat on a desk and wish to open it from there but end up having to pick up the phone for it to read my face. Camera is great though when on portrait mode getting the bokkeh effect with the blurred background sometimes it blurs to much of the subject, that may just be me being picky. Overall though loving it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Overall this is a great phone. Integration of the software and powerful hardware make it zippy fast, sensitive to touch and responsive to use. It has a great 5.8 inch screen that goes mostly edge of edge of visible screen (not exacty to the edge though). It feel luxurious. And it works.New features such as face recognition and emojis are a plus. The loss of fingerprint security is annoying. The camera is one of the better ones out there - i loved the quality. It takes a little while to relearn the gestures though.However it is quite expensive. I do not exactly think it quite justifies the extra $500 AUD cost over the iphone 8 but if you are willing to pay premium, why not! IOS is still my favourite.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The screen, especially the colour reproduction is stunning. The front and back cameras are simply the best mobile camera I've ever used. System is silkily smooth thanks to the A11 chips. The bezeless design provides well-balanced size and weight. The top notch is a failure to me though since it doesn't fit the whole design and jeopardise some app's display. Price is acceptable when comparing to the 256GB model.Overall satisfied with it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Used: Three to four months.Pros: Build quality, design, display colour accuracy, Apple Store service, camera.Cons: Face ID is not perfect, screen known to be scratch prone.I did not list price as a con. I honestly feel the phone is worth it based on its design, build quality and for what I use it for. If you’re concerned about it’s price and care little for design and Face ID and still want an iPhone, the 8 is the better buy.Face ID works well, however it will not work with my sunglasses and your face must be at a similar angle each time. It’s much better than face unlock on competing models, but can certainly be improved on future models. Regardless, it’s still very convenient and I prefer it to Touch ID.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The Iphone X is quite easy to use, though it takes a while to get used to having no home button. The camera quality is improved a lot however other features are similar to the other series. It is quite expensive for something that is not too different to other iphones. You could probably get the same camera quality from Samsung for a more reasonable price",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"I  have waited months to replace my iPhone for this phone, only to find that without a screen protector within one day of putting in my pocket and looking after it very carefully the screen scratched easily and badly.  Shame on Apple for knowingly selling it like this with no gorilla glass and forcing you to buy the apple plan In order to have it replaced with another fee on top. Samsungs screen does not scratch so easily. Still getting used to the rest of the phone",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,This is the best iPhone by far. The screen is just beautiful with great colour reproduction. The screen is bezeless so it is big without having to have a big device. This is good because it makes it the perfect size for holding with one hand.Can’t fault the software as it runs super smooth. The camera is one of the best. Takes sharp pictures and has great colours.,Productreview.com.au

iphone,4,"For the most part, Face ID works, however it is isn't always accurate. I would say it's strike rate is about 8/10.

I wouldn't recommend this phone unless you have money to burn.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This is my first Apple phone after being a solid Android fan for years, and I am blown away. It’s fast, responsive, and takes amazing photos. I was scared that it would be too fragile, but It has already survived a drop without any issues.

The screen quality is AMAZING (super HD), phone size is perfect (I can't use the tiny 5 anymore), camera is unbelievably clear, and the phone is built very sturdy. The battery life can easily extend to 1.5 days of heavy use, the no home  button is easily adaptable, and the touch screen is very responsive. I have taken the phone travelling all over Europe (in freezing temperatures) with no issue at all.I only docked one star due to the hefty price (~$1,800 AUD) and the fact that I cannot listen to music and charge my phone at the same time (due to the no headphone jack). Apart from that its a really nice phone, hard to damage and definitely no regrets!",Productreview.com.au

I have used this for some time now, and I quite enjoy it.The Pros- face ID- new gestures- screen almost goes edge to edge (makes it more modern looking)- battery life lasted longer compared to my Iphone 7 Plus- easier to hold to take selfies- good front camera, and can use portrait mode for selfies too!The Cons- EXPENSIVE!- they don't have 128 GB model, which is done intentionally to force us Apple users to get the model above- Face ID does not work when you first wake up in the morning... happened a few times with me, and had to put in passcode to unlock it.- EXPESNIVE. Did I mention this already?If it wasn't some cashback I got with my credit card, I would not have purchased this phone because of the  RRP.

I definitely enjoy using it over the past couple of months.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The iPhone X is the best phone I've ever used or owned! I must admit that when I first heard that Apple were dropping the finger print scanner out for the Face ID, I almost didn't buy it. I had become so accustom to how easy the finger print unlock was that I assumed that Face ID wouldn't be as easy or as good, but boy was I wrong. It's a million times better, I can pull the phone out of my pocket and glance at it as I'm pulling it out and it's unlocked! I'm not kidding, it's that good! I was 100% surprised with how good Face ID works. It also makes using your phone so much faster, as when you go to a website with a login that's saved on your phone it automatically kicks the Face ID in and fills out the password so all you need to do it hit login, rather than move you finger down to the scanner, wait for it to work, then move your finer back up to hit the login button. This also works the same in apps!The camera on this thing is ridicules, the quality of the photos that come off of this phone are as good and any camera under $1000, I'm a very, very amateur photographer with a DSLR and I can put these photos up against it any day. Obviously you don't have all the zoom and long exposures and other features that a DSLR has but as a standard camera is amazing. Where it really shines though is with portrait mode, I taken so many amazing photos of my toddler with this phone that I wouldn't have ever had if I had to get out my DSLR as the moment would have gone by the time I got there.All the other things Apple had to change due to the fact it doesn't have a home button anymore, have been done perfectly by Apple, it so intuitive to use that after only a week of owning it I almost forgot how to use my old phone and was trying to control it with the new swipe gestures. The only thing that I seen to struggle with this the screen capture, once out of every 20 times I try to use it I accidently close the phone.Everything else works basically the same as any other iPhone only faster. I've not had any issues with the battery as I get more than a day out of it always, so no complaints there.I would recommend this phone to anyone in need of a new phone, you wont regret it!",Productreview.com.au

iphone,4,"Obviously being the newest iPhone, it has all the newest features. It's faster, has an incredible camera, has wireless charging etc. This does come at a cost though. It loses TouchID, which to me is actually really important and also is much much heavier. It's more slippery than my previous iPhone 7 and also requires you to take care of it more, incase of breaks. I'm also not a fan of the chrome edges, but that's a personal thing. The biggest killer is the cost. Yes it is the best iPhone, but that's if you're willing the spend the money.

It is more one hand manageable, but I miss the wider display. Face ID is good but wish it had both face ID and touch ID. Face ID can be a bit slow and doesn't work with sunglasses etc. Some of the gestures could be improved (accessing the quick launch menu from top right) could be better implemented but this is just a software update.

iphone,4,Love the way it unlocks the phone make life so much easier .but some of the old app on which I used to use on iPhone 7 not compatable with iPhone X . May be will fix with the update .but overalll the performance wise it’s pretty good phone.Cheers,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The phrase best iPhone yet seems to be something that is said at every announcement of a new iPhone by Apple executives. More often then not it’s true, in the case of the iPhone X (ten) it’s true, with some caveats.The design of the phone is flawless but so is the design of recent Samsung Galaxy phones, the screen is OLED (finally) and the speakers are best in class, they are loud, there’s a forward facing speaker (a rarity in mobile phones) and they don’t distort too much a loud volumes.The iPhone is C is fast, really fast but so was my iPhone 7, sometimes you never realise how slow your phone is until you are a generation or two behind and you use your friends new phone and apps just spring open instantly. The camera works great and Face ID is something you get used to really quickly, it works 8-9 our of every 10 times, but the issue here is you really notice those 1 or 2 times Face ID fails you, and I think that is because the process of Face ID is so seamless you don’t even know it’s happening until it fails you.As for the missing home button, that is something I actually grew to like, gesture become second nature, although having to tap and hold on an app in the multitasking menu before swiping up to exit it is more then a little annoying.But the biggest issue with the new iPhone X is while it is a whole new take on iPhone with a new design and screen, it’s still just an iPhone. I’m not sure what it is but maybe expectations have just been set impossibly high.Overall if you like bigger screens and that is a deal breaker, go for an iPhone 8 Plus or Samsung Galaxy, otherwise the iPhone X really is the best iPhone yet, but did anyone really think the newest iPhone wouldn’t be?P.S: I forgot to mention anything about the notch because I actually forgot about it, I guess that’s a testament to the design of the iPhone X.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"This phone has been impressive, as you would expect from a Apple product.However the leap from generation to generation has been getting smaller and smaller, I’ve owner every iPhone from the original one and while in the past I would rush out to get the latest model I feel I would have been better served keeping my iPhone 7Plus or getting a iPhone 8 Plus like my wife did.The battery is only okay at best and the lack of a fingerprint sensor is really missed when you are laying on your side at night (the face detection gets a little freaked out).If this phone was under $1000 I’d call it a great phone no questions asked but asking $1600 for it is just pure greed.Save yourself the money and buy a iPhone 8 Plus. It has all the features of the iPhone X for hundreds less..",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"There are high expectations for an Apple product and once again they have delivered. New face-id security and OLED screen was highly anticipated. To be truthfully honest, the Face ID can be annoying at first since your phone screen can be constantly on. Some problems encountered include overheating which was disappointing. The price can be steep and recommended to purchase via a plan.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Waited for so long for apple to make a full screen phone and I have finally gotten my wishe. Great phone, excellent size to fit in one hand yet the screen is bigger than any other apple phone. I never liked the plus models because I needed two hands to use them and this phone solves that problem. The colours on the screen are vibrant and the camera is something else! You get photos close to the quality of photos taken by some DSLR cameras. A bit pricy but worth every dollar.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The price was quite steep, however going from an iPhone 5s that dead after 2 hours of use the iPhone X was great lasting me 2 days per full charge. The face ID astounded me as the device scanned your face only 2 times, at the beginning the Face ID occasionally didn't recognise my face when lying down however, after a week or two it was a breeze and recognised my face always. The face ID makes it seem like there is no lock to you but there is to others. Don't regret my purchase at all!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The only failure is the facial recognition. Try having glasses on and off, it'll get highly confused and will not have a good ""hit"" rate of opening. The annoying thing as well is if you carry your phone and it sees your face and recognises it it will unlock even if the phone is at a distance next to your jeans pocket. So be aware that it could dummy dial. It does what it says otherwise.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"pros- quick processing. clear photos and videos. Apple's usual easy to use ecosystem.It was actually really easy to transfer data from the old phone to the new one.Cons - the facial recognition can be annoying at times. for instance when you;re wearing sunglasses, you may have to take it off to unlock your phone. Which is slower than the old finger print system. Certain angles are not recognised either. And when you first wake up in the morning, it doesn't unlock when you're squinting at your phone, not completely ready to open your eyes wide.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The Apple iPhone X features a stunning OLED screen with vibrant colours and deep blacks. The new Face-ID security feature works well most of the time, but fails often in challenging environments (like if you’re unlocking your phone with a drinking straw in your mouth). The little notch at the top was annoying at first, but I grew to love it as I saw how developers were cleverly integrating it. The speakers are fantastic, and the camera quality tempts me to leave my DSLR at home (though it’s not quite there yet). The build quality is stunning, however, the all glass design makes it extremely fragile. Purchasing Apple Care or other insurance is a must. Wireless charging and quick charging are both excellent features, however both require additional expensive cables and units.The Apple iPhone X is one of the best Smartphones I’ve ever used, however the high price makes it a very tough sell when you can get a comparable phone for about $500 cheaper.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"It took alot quicker than i thought to get used to face id. Overall - it is a good phone, abit pricey. Also it can be abit hard to use apple pay with face id cos you'll need to stare at the screen before paying while with touch id you can just scan your fingerprint while taking you phone out",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Absolutely amazing.Yes Samsung has these features years ago, yes Samsung has this screen years ago, yes Samsung this Samsung that but having everything is not so important, having everything together at the right time and in a product which is much superior to even hold is as important as it can get.Big icons, absolutely amazing camera and video quality.Love the AR FEATURE WITH GAMES ETC.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Being an early adopter I rushed out to get the latest phone. Now having used it over the past few months I can confirm that while it's still the best phone money can buy, it's not entirely worth the exorbitant list price.The gorgeous OLED screen is absolutely a game changer. The rear telephoto camera significantly improves over  the 8 Plus particularly in low light. The front camera is sufficient and Face ID is interesting but not essential. The lack of a home button mean major changes in how you navigate.The Notch is still the all round weirdest product design choice and sure to be discussed in UX conferences as a rare misstep for apple.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Due to being the ecosystem of Apple and I have to keep using iPhone. This is the first phone I own has a high-resolution screen. I've been using my iPhone 6 and I feel like wow, a big upgrade for me. My partner also own one and really happy with it",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"There’s no reason to hate on a newly released phone that is the same price as buying it directly from Apple. I think these phones are awesome. Of course, I don’t have the money or an issue with my current phone, so I can’t buy it now, but rest assured I would.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Bought this from Apple Official website.  The only problem is that the price is quite high.  The face ID is very easy to use. I bought the apple care+ together since I am a little worried about the OLED screen repair fee. I heard that the OLED screen can be burned if you use very often. So far I love this product.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I have been using this phone for the past few months and it's been great. The phone has a OLED screen with great colours. Face ID is really innovative and nice to use. The glass back is very fragile so a cover is a must. The camera takes nice photos.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"While the iPhone X is amazing and is a really innovative device from Apple, for a phone that costs almost $1600 it doesn't really outperform other flagship phones. At least not enough to make it worth it. Face ID is great but having to swipe up every time to unlock the phone is a bit cumbersome, especially if you're used to unlocking phones with fingerprint sensors. iOS in general is just a bit bloated and tedious coming from an Android phone, and animojis is quite gimmicky. Other than that, the phone is fast, great size and feel in the hand, amazing camera and decent battery life.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Best mobile phone you can buy, Face ID is two years ahead of what Samsung offers (Samsung is still in 2D face detect where a picture of your face can already bypass the security).Its feels good on hand, the latest Apple chips feel very fast, no more home button, water proof, improved camera all pack into the Glass & stainless steel design.  It is a expensive phone and it feels like one.Highly recommended if you can afford.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This is a beautiful phone, has great functionality. I did go from android to apple and I have to say, everything seems a lot smoother. There's a lot more uniformity with iPhones. It also looks great with the screen going to the edge, very sleek and modern. 64GB is absolutely enough for photos, apps (e.g. Spotify, facebook, messenger etc.)",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Honestly wasn't expecting anything to groundbreaking with this device but once you hold it in your hand you understand how great it really is. The full screen display is beautiful and the colour is very true. I couldn't go back to having a home button anymore. Apple have done it again.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I liked the notch. I embraced the notch. I thought it was top-notch design.But reading about how the apps are unoptimised and just a bit of a mess in general I am bummed. I’ll be going from a Plus size model to something that most of the time looks like a small Nexus 5X. For the time being anyway. Should’ve skipped this generation, really. But the hype was too strong. Love to see when holding it on my hand the design looks so beautiful, but apple needs to stepup the game and do more changes and perfomance optimizations with the iOS",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Honestly the best phone I've received so far. It's fast and easy to use. The use of no touch button was easy as apple has always been very good with user interface. No plans on going back to Android and it always seems seamless to use. 256 was a great bump,Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,I’ll be honest the battery life is just shocking and I don’t think the camera is to crash hot either. I had a Samsung galaxy note 8 and I found it a much much better phone. The screen was clearer and the photos were sharper. I like how it looks and feels in your hand but I should’ve stuck with Samsung.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"This phone is an excelent daily driver all the major tech under one roof. Photos are really clear, video has accurate colour. Battery life is 24hrs of moderate use at about 60% brightness which is good for outdoir viewing.. I would reccomend this phone to any apple lover out there.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,2,"I have moved from the 7+ and gone to the IphoneX and I do not like it at all!The facial recognition never works, you then have to wait for the passcode to pop up very frustrating!Has a greeat camera but so does the iphone 8+ for a way better price! overall would not recoment at all especially if you are going from the larger phone to the X/.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"This phone is slim and amazing and the style is sleek and works so smoothly and fast, the looks the style the speed this phone has everything, a definate buy! A little pricy but worth it for sure, i would recommend buying yourself one of the apple iphone X's .",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"I'd been waiting for the iPhone X for 2 years. My review follows this rant.2 years ago rumours started to circulate about this upcoming edge-to-edge fully glassed piece of art, which would be released on the iPhone's 10th anniversary. It would encompass the fastest processor, a 4k camera, 4k AMOLED screen, reality augmentation, new speakers, Face ID, In-screen Touch ID, and proximity wireless charging (a charging station that transmits a charge without contact).If the rumours held true this device would be the king of all Smart phones, no question.Over time, the hype was diminished by the release of Samsung and Google phones, which contained a lot of the above, but Apple still had an advantage; FaceID, In-screen Touch-ID and proximity charging. But as the release drew near, the rumours began to remain just that, rumours. Proximity charging was no longer on the list, the In-screen TouchID proved to be a nightmare for their Engineers so was pulled, the screen would be OLED @ 2k, and not quite edge to edge, in-fact, they'd introduce a weird notch to house the front facing camera and FaceID scanner along the top. 4 major technological downgrades.I've been an iPhone user since gen 3 and when September 2017 rolled around, a month prior to the X's release, I was, for the first time, contemplating switching to Samsung. But my history with Samsung's non-mobile electronics has been fraught with mental anguish; Washing Machine, TV and Fridge all broke down within 2 years (average - see my TV review), just trash; this coupled with my social circle advising that I stick with Apple are the reasons I did.REVIEW:I'd pre-ordered as soon as the online counter hit zero and was the first of anyone I know to receive the iPhone X and Apple Watch 3. Literally a couple of days after the official launch date. It was an exciting day. But like all shiny new toys, you're blinded by its shininess, so let's fast forward 3 months, which is how long I've owned an iPhone X for.PROS:Looks - It is a lot better looking than expected. A bit of old school roundedness mixed in with new school lines.Gestures without home button - The thoughtful gestures make navigation seamless and pleasant. It has improved dramatically.Screen - Great size. Crisp and beautiful colours. Even though the FaceID/Camera dash drops like 5-6mm from the top of the screen, surprisingly, it is virtually unnoticeable during general use.2 x Cameras (wide and telephoto) - Wow, every photo and video recorded is insanely detailed. The video resolution is mental and the built-in steadyshot tech makes shooting videos without shake, easy.Portrait Mode - Blurry backgrounds, Studio lighting and black backgrounds. Photos including selfies contain an enormous amount of detail and are simply stunning, like, DSLR stunning (I used to shoot with a Canon 60D DSLR). Once you get used to using these modes, the results truly are mind blowing. You can also change the portrait mode after the photo has been taken. I wonder if they plan on building these functions into Video?Glass - Like liquid. The upgraded glass is flawless.Augmented Reality - Funny, and precise but I don't use it much.Processor - Faster than ever!! Opening, closing and operating apps, multi-tasking between, all virtually instant! It is super fast.Speakers - Definitely a huge step up as far as phone speakers are concerned. There's also bass! And I'm a massive basshead, so it's astonishing how good the speaker quality has improved. Oh, and the volume seems to be 30-40% louder than the older models, imo.3D Touch - Always useful but not so much now with all the new touch gestures. I hope Apple don't render it redundant as I still use it, and they have a habit of removing useful features.Battery - Surprisingly good, my phone lasts a day and a half on average use. Don't get me wrong, I can still kill it in a day, but that's with heavy video use. It's been off the charger for over 9 hours and it still has around 80% life in it.Screenshot - Current IOS makes screenshots more useful, i.e. crop, share, disregard without saving to photos, draw...etc. Use this almost daily.FaceID - Although it's more annoying than good, I do appreciate that it recognises me with or without glasses/sunglasses/hats, even a wig and facepaint (Halloween party).CONS:Lock button - With the removal of the home button, they've loaded up the functions into the lock button, maybe too many? Tap and hold for Siri; I inadvertently activate her all the time. Double tap to activate ApplePay; if I don't accidentally activate Siri, I activate ApplePay instead. Lock+Up volume to access 'Power to Slide' or 'Emergency' settings; I've managed to accidentally set off an alarm I didn't know I had, and call emergency services. Up, then Down, then Lock to 'hard reset'? Down+Lock for Screenshot, this is good, and of course, simply just lock and unlock.It is a very busy little button!In addition, I only use Siri with 'Hey Siri' so I don't know why they don't have an option to deactivate Siri from the lock button.Touch to wake - This is just annoying. You'll instantly discover how sensitive the screen is. It can however, be turned off in the settings.FaceID - ""They say 60% of the time, it works everytime"" comes to mind. You quite literally have to be selfie ready everytime time you want to unlock it, buy something or open a secure app. It was funny and interesting at first, but now, it's just tiresome. It fails around 40% of the time, where TouchID failed maybe 2%, normally after a swim? When FaceID fails, it gives you a second chance before requiring your PIN, which delays unlocking the phone by like 3 seconds, which is equally nothing and everything, especially when I wasn't experiencing this issue with TouchID.It also won't recognise you first thing in the morning, or from certain angles, like when you're lying on your side or back. I'm a fit guy so I can't imagine gravity warping my face to the point it's unrecognisable?Weight - It is quite a heavy phone due to the upgraded aluminium body. I dread the day I eventually drop it on my face while using it in bed.Body finish - Thought it would be smoother. Has a slight edge between the glass and stainless steel.What's not in the box - I was hoping to get Airpods, and/or a Wireless Charging pad, and/or a fast charging adapter. Nope, nope, and nopity nope. You have to buy all of this stuff separately. Not happening.Well, that's it!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This is by far my most favorite phone ever, the size is so perfect, has all the visible screen size of a plus but being smaller it makes it easy for a small handed person to hold. The camera is to die for it's totally brilliant, love not having a home button, it's so responsive, love the ease of the face recognition, easy to pair all bluetooth devises, love the wireless charging options, happy that I can walk in the rain & not totally stress if it gets damp!! this phone is truly my new besty!!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Got it as a Christmas gift. It’s got Great features. Facial recognition Good size. I like that it is full screen, the camera is 4K which is amazing and the sound is better than any iPhone, I also like the fact that it is big. The graphics are out of this world.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I’ve had this phone for just over a month now.  It took a bit of getting used to the swiping up.  But now I forget and try and swipe on my iPad Air.The larger screen is for me Great.  Loving the upgraded camera as well it takes brilliant photos.  One of the reasons I’ve purchased it means I won’t need a seperate camera when away overseas later this year.I’ve recently been in hospital and had to use the ear phones.  The microphone on them was just excellent.It does use its battery a bit quicker than the 6s that I’ve upgraded from. But still not terrible.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I only update my iPhones every 3-4 years and ummed and ahhed between the 8 and the 10.I didn’t want the 8plus to achieve the good camera as it’s size, I feel, would be problematic.I read many reviews on line and did my diligent research, and although it was difficult to justify the price of the X I’m happy that’s the choice I made.The camera is amazing, the portait mode is professional and I love that you can edit within that after you’ve taken the portrait.And not that I plan on using my iPhone underwater, but the fact that it’s waterproof is peace of mind for those accidents in the bathroom!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I believe apple had done a fantastic job with the iPhone X release. The revolutionary Face ID feature has put a noticeable dent in the smart phone industry and I believe is the more well thought out technology on any smart phone too date. I must admit, when purchasing the device I didn’t think it would be this great but it definitely proved me wrong!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"A bunch of things you can like, it’s usual Apple product, easy to use. Something I don’t like is the size, it’s too small compared to previous iPhones owned. It was great camera, screen and is also waterproof! Apple is Apple! They’ve done it again! Recommended product in my opinion, go get one!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Upgraded from the 6 Plus, which I was already a hide fan of, with this purchase. This phone is smaller but has a similar size screen which I found more than satisfactory. Took some getting used to not having a home button but I found the face recognition for unlocking quick and efficient. Takes very good photos.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The concept of a full screen iPhone made it so appealing. It's pretty much a regular size iPhone with a near-Plus size screen. When I first opened the box and picked up the phone, I immediately noticed the heaviness of the device. Quite surprising especially for its size. It took me around a week to get familiar with the usability of the device with the non-home button, and the swiping functions.The battery life is very mediocre. If anything I feel the battery is a big negative. It would only last one whole day. I had high expectations that it would last at least a day and a half. My previous phone was the iPhone 7 Plus and I felt the battery life was much better.The full screen is pretty good except for when you watch full screen, you will have the a little obstruction that takes probably 5% of the screen away. This obstruction is caused by the earpiece and front camera. Watching a movie or a show is not much of an issue but it's a little awkward having an obstruction on the screen.The face recognition function is great but it can be annoying at times. The great part of it is being able to unlock it just by lifting up the phone and looking directly at it. The annoying part is that there will be times where it will not recognise your face and you'll be prompted to enter your pin. Another annoying part is when I have my phone on the table I can't use my finger print to unlock. I would have to either use the pin or pick up the phone to my face.Besides the non-home button, there's actually not much of a difference between the X and the predecessor. For the price, I would probably recommend waiting for the next iPhone 2018 where Apple will most likely make the phone much more lighter in weight, increase the battery life, and have quick-charging ability.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Love the face recognition. Amazing how well everything works and how many things I can do with it. Best phone camera I've ever seen. The battery life is the best yet. The screen is the clearest and cleanest I've ever had. I couldn't recommend this phone more highly. Expensive but worth the cost. Looking forward to what comes next,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,Lots of things to love about this phone - all the usual apple gear and ease of use. Things not to love - the size. I came from a 6plus and the screen was bigger - the X is similar length but not as wide. Don’t love that - it makes the keyboard squishy. I miss the headphone jack. I like the facial recognition but hate that I have to pick the phone up to open it. I wish there was a fingerprint option as well.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"This is without a doubt the most powerful and advanced mobile phone in this day and age. With a top of the range processor, camera, screen, memory, waterproofing; it is unbeatable. However, changes to the hardware and software such as the removal of the headphone jack as well as the home button, usage of the phone takes some time getting used to - and for some, they may never get used to it. If you think this is a problem, I would suggest going for the iPhone 8 line at a much lower price point.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"So much faster than iPhone 7, battery will last two days if I don’t go into areas with no phone reception.Facial recognition that I thought would be a gimmick is so good, so much better than the finger print system.Siri seems to work better than it did on the 7, I can make numerous calls in the truck and not touch the phone!!.I am so pleased I changed and spent the money, well spent for sure.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"Face ID junk featureNever turn on with Face ID in the night or very close to your phone.And Eyes need to be fully open.And in the middle of the night, no one wants to open full eyes.Pretty junk feature.Touch ID is a more convenient feature.Thanks",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Great design and fast, face ID works well, love the face ID it works well. nicely fit into the hand with a great screen size. charging is fast and the battery last really well.

iphone,5,"Been using my Iphone X for about 4mths now. The phone runs fast and the screen is so big, All apps and games run without a problem. The phone is just wow loving it all, When taking pictures you can pick for so many option and the picture comes out so good. I would buy it again",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The fact that it is based on face recognition makes it very easy for me to work with, although it would take time for some companies to adopt their applications with this new feature.A side from this the big screen is very good for reading stuff in the web and the whole thing is useful.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I bought the iPhone X 2 months ago and it’s extremely fast, always recognises my Face ID, never glitches or crashes and is it easy and simple to use. I would definitely recommend buying this product as it’s size is very nice and easy to hold. All programs run fast and easy.Best way I’ve spent my money.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This phone is very handy, it has every feature I need to run business away from the office. It is light, and slim and I found it very easy to use. the phone itself is not very different from the last model however its just great that Apple continue their great service in providing a reliable product",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"One of the best phone that I have used in the last 10 years. Great battery life and the face recognition works flawlessly even in pitch dark. Bit pricy but it worth it, considering you are not upgrading every year.Just put a good case for protection, which these days Is a must on their phones.Optus delivered in 2 weeks with free sports subscription.Very happy with the product and its features.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"When you spend $1600 on a new phone you want it to be impressive.  The iPhone X is mostly impressive particularly with battery life, speed and apps.  My former Samsung Galaxy 6 still has an edge in some interactivity and intuitiveness but the battery was struggling to last a day.  The iPhone screen is probably better than the Samsung galaxy 6 and its is slightly smaller, but the difference is not really significant.  Overall happy with IPhone X so far.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"A bit of getting used to at first: no home button, full screen. But ""swipe up from the bottom"" is quickly as natural as ""click on the home button"". Face ID is great - it basically disappears into the background, so all you have to do is pick up your phone and it feels like it's always unlocked. It's fast, and the screen is georgeous. It's physically about the same size as the ""S"" model phones even though the screen is about the same size as a ""plus"". The camera is awesome. Only downside, I guess, is that it is expensive and with glass front and back you would not want to drop it.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This phone is absolutely apples best phone yet. Take away the gimmicks of Animoji and selfies and this phone is powerful. The camera, the OS, the OLED screen. I’ve always been an Apple boy and always will be an Apple boy. This phone has set a standard for smartphones that no doubt others will soon follow.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,All in all it is a good phone. I don't think it is much different to the iphone 8 but it is a great phone. The screen is so large it is awesome for watching movies the graphics are good too. Battery life is not too good but thats to be expected with iphone.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,Going from the 7 plus to the X was hardBut I wanted the latest phone.I really struggled for the first week with all the gestures and consider swapping with my son how I had purchased the 8 but then I was like no dam 15 year old is getting this phone I will get out of my comfort zone and I now 5 weeks on love it !I have had glitches but they have been fixed with updates.Camera is AAA+++,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I bought iphoneX for my wife and she's loving it especially the face recognition. The screen is a bit small compare to iPhone 7 plus. However, the screen clarity is on top.This smart phone is quite expensive so If you're a big tight budget don't buy outright. Just go with deal phone service provider with zero interest.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"The Apple iPhone X would be an absolutely wonderful device, if it wasn't for that notch at the top. That notch is so annoying. Seriously. Face ID is great, and real innovation, a first in many years for this company. Also, the fact that the iPhone X doesn't come with a Face Charge adapter is absolutely mind-boggling, you pay a super premium price for this phone, but don't get peripherals that you phone is made to work with.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"While the ‘button’ from the bottom has been removed there is now a gap up the top which is quite annoying. It’s still easy enough to use, light and love the Face ID. Overall do feel this phone is ‘faster’ once you get used to it which was important for me",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This is definitely the best iPhone ever made, though whether its worth the asking price is questionable. The screen is absolutely beautiful (I hated the notch at first, but you quickly get used to it).But FaceID is the killer feature. It's fast, simple and secure enough to replace your fingerprint. It's almost like not having your phone locked. It makes the phone seem incredibly smart and it's something the competition will struggle to replicate for a while.The camera is also incredible, and portrait mode works pretty great for the most part - when it's perfect it takes photos that make people say ""how was this taken on a phone?""I'm really, really happy I bought this. It's the best iPhone yet.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This phone is nothing short of amazing! At first I was skeptical about the no home button and Face ID but I have come to love it! Swiping up to unlock and get out of apps feels so natural now, Face ID works flawlessly almost 100% of the time even when in bed and it’s dark, the screen is outstanding and both the cameras with portrait mode make the photos look like their from a professional camera, while sometimes the front camera will has trouble distinguishing between background and focusing on the subject, most off the time it’s great. Battery life could be better but is okay when using wireless charging throughout the day",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Have used iphone X for one month, so far so good.The screen looks very good, and also very fast. It is ok for non-square screen although I do not like it. In addition, it will be better if the screen becomes little bit bigger.Do not like the feature which does not have 3.5mm headphone jack, and have to use lightning for charging and headphone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,The iPhone X didn’t disappoint.It is everything a iPhone is and more.The face recognition was spot on and easier to use then the finger scan.There was some small connection problems initially and the iCloud did not download everything seamlessly which is very unlike Apple.All in all the IPhone is great and didn’t disappoint and a much much better mobile then Samsung or any of the other mobiles on the market.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,2,"For a company that has made a great phone in terms of functionality, camera, speed etc they have got it wrong in some very important areas such as durability and price.Durability  - Glass front and back - this phone is the most fragile iPhone yet. It cracked on the very first drop in all strength tests.Price - $1,600 AUD for a phone is outrageous. Technology should be going down in price, not up. This phone isn't revolutionary like the first iPhone was. It does nothing better than any Android device but charges a premium because of their brandReplacement costs - Over $800 if you damage your phone. I cracked mine whilst in a sturdy case just with gentle pressure.Battery - the battery life is good but already after 2 months, it started to diminish.This will be my last Apple purchase - I am sick of their arrogance, price and lack of ability to build a phone that can withstand daily use.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This is one of the most secure way to keep your stuff private .. in finger print scan your close ones could keep their finger prints as password but with this Face ID only you can unlock your iPhone. Other gestures are working perfectly, it seems hard to operate initially with out home button but with in couple of days I got used to with it and found it simpler.And what can I say about the display. Crispiest display. Loved the camera with portrait mode. I don’t need DSLR camera anymore.Overall I loved this version of iPhone and looking forward to see next one too..",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,The Apple iPhone X is the best Phone Apple has put out with a large screen and easy to use apps  .Unlike the previous Apple iPhones the screen is from top to bottom and the camera is better it has many more features you what be disappointed with this phone,Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,I upgraded from an iPhone 6s and to be honest I am a little underwhelmed with the iPhone X. The facial recognition is great and it does have a bigger and clearer screen however for the price I am not sure it is worth it. If I had known at the time about Apple's policy of slowing down older phones through software updates I would probably have just purchased a new battery for my 6S,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Just purchased the iPhone X after having the iPhone 6 Plus.  Just love the ease of use as I thought it would be difficult to adjust not having a home button on the bottom as I have been use to for the past several years.  Takes an awesome photo - apps are quick and easy to download.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"What can I say, I am a fan of Apple products especially their phones. I am aware that other brands are good competitors to this iPhoneX model and probably cheaper,  I wouldn't change mine for any other brand. Love the new features, the size is perfect , the responsiveness is fast, the capacity give you peace of mind and is ready very smart. So many good features but I am impressed with the improved Siri, who came back to the Xmodel smarter than ever.",Productreview.com.au

Far better than finger print technology. Love it,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I bought iPhone X yesterday from Office works at the very cool price (around $1600). It will be bit struggle for the iPhone users to get used to no home button. Also, the facial recognition for unlocking iPhone is a bit not worthy.It took me a little time to adjust to the changes like closing apps is different and the zoom in and out still annoys me but overall the battery lasts the larger screen is good and it is quick too to open and close browsing windows.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Never been this satisfied with a phone 3 months after buying it. I don't get sick of this thing!! I have it in Silver and the colour is so flashy and outstanding. The performance is amazing. The camera is out of this world, I don't even use my DSLR anymore. The face recognition is so convenient for all secure apps and having iCloud Keychain keeps all my devices linked to my accounts. Good job Apple!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6 plus to the X.The phone has a good battery life, possibly not as long as my iPhone 6 plus when new but with only light use I easily get 2 days use for a charge.The most controversial feature the face unlocking works well and gets better with time (it appears to learn).The LTE modem is amazingly fast, I regulary get 150mb+ speed test results.  Much faster than previous iPhones!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,So far so good. I haven’t had any dramas with the issues that have been put forth in the media. Camera is definitely better. The phone itself responds so much quicker to demands . Speaker is also better than my 6plus. I do like that the screen fills the whole front of the phone but it did take me a bit to get used to not having a home button.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Awesome product! Well worth the wait and line up. New features are great, can only see this brand growing and dominating the market.’I would never go to a Samsung!! Have showed all my friend and colleagues to much of their delight. I think I’ve drummed up some sales for Apple!!!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I've tried iPhone before and it's good, hardware is excellent and the service Apple offer is as good as it can get. iOS 11.xx is better than before and the gesture based OS is smooth to operate and has many advantages that is usually apparent when the manufacture also supplies the firmware.  The Apple Ecosystem is really good where other devices just dovetail and this phone is no exceptionPros:  Fast, great backup service, quality build (although the glass is nothing like the Samsung which feels more premium).  For a phone the size it is the display is crisp and clear, bright in strong sunlight, Audio quality is excellent and carriers support features like vOLTE ( HD calling in apple terms) and Wi Fi calling unlike some phones that could but are not supported (EG the LG V30).  Software is fluid.  Changing to a new iPhone is as easy as ever with your previous settings and apps easily restored.  Camera is great and Apple pay is fast.Face unlock is really good and very fastCons: Apple is the true Nanny state product, the controls over this system and phone are still as tight as ever, consequently customisation is limited to an overbearing degree,  Despite the price tag and the great build there's not much difference really between this and the last models, the operating system is old and boring which drags down the potential of a well designed phone.  Whilst this may suit many who like the simple and restrictive eco system for many the purchase of this phone not worthwhile as it's not really different to all the earlier models.The cost is absurdThe notch ... for some it's there larger than life and very annoying, software that hides the notch in wallpapers does not work in apps.  The only possible purpose is to make the screen measurement larger but Apple should allow customers to have this as a black area containing useful information where sensors allow instead of having a bite out of the top of the phone.  The notch is about as useful as an ashtray on a motorcycle/The headphone jack is disappointing but inevitable.  The lightning connector should have been replaced with a USB- Type C connector if Apple were serious about moving forward, there is really no excuse for this at all.Most of the issues relate to iOS holding back the potential of this phone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The camera is amazing.Getting used to no home button, which I thought was going to be hard. Was a non issue from the first swipe.The phone is a dream to use. The screen is beautiful, the brightness and colours never disappoint.Face ID is great.And the face tracking emojis are very cute .Overall 10/10. Best phone Apple has created to date. Best smartphone out there.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The phone is a nice evolution from previous models.  No huge changes or advancements.  the camera is great and the phones works well.  OS is responsive and battery life gets you a full day with heavy use.Dislikes - fewer colour options than previous models, only off white and black.  teh screen is also a bit smaller than my Iphone 6s Plus.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"This phone is lovely to use. A beautiful screen and great feel. The hardware is very responsive and capable. Admittedly it was a little annoying to use at first, as the lack of headphone jack was a bit awkward. however now that I have bluetooth headphones and a wireless charger, those annoyances have completely disappeared!Both cameras on the phone are great. The built in camera app on iOS11 is also much more capable of taking advantage of the cameras. It also charges quickly and battery lasts as long or better than I expected (Previously had a 6 Plus).There have been some dicey aspects to the launch of iOS 11, namely keyboard glitches, some podcast glitches, a few crashes, and it wouldn't be fair to not mention those, as this phone cannot run without iOS 11, so they are somewhat hand in hand. However these glitches have been quickly addressed by apple, and have certainly not been catastrophic.I recommend the phone, particularly if you want to be able to take quick, mindless and beautiful photos.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Apple can never go wrong on their technology, love the camera features especially the selfie one along with the speed and clarity on the screen, the face if feature is awesome  u.

iphone,3,"I ordered the iphone X a while ago, and it finally arrive about a month ago. Over the past five years I've been using both Android and iphones, usually one for work and the other for personal use so I'm very familiar with what each can do; but as I use both it also means I haven't moved my whole life over to the Apple ecosystem and can switch easily between the two.The iphone X is okay, the large screen is great, the camera is also great, but that's really it and considering the price I expected more. The facial recognition works a lot of the time, even sometimes when I'm wearing sunglasses, but it takes longer to get into the phone than when using the finger print scanner on my old iphone, so seems to be a bit of a gimmick! The software is pretty similar to my old iphone, couple of minor tweaks here and there, so nothing special. The phone runs very smoothly though, and is quicker than my old one (but that may be because Apple intentionally slowed the old one down, so really hard to gauge!!)Overall, it's an impressive phone, but I really don't think it's worth it. The iphone 7 range still seems pretty good to me, alternatively one of the many Android phones at a cheaper price.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Its the best gadget i can get. Cant get better than this. It have everything . Its beautifulin tearms of looks, have awonderful camera with various differnt functins, face id to unlock , the screen is so big, its too fast too. Has so many in built apps on which i can work",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"After almost two months of using Face ID, it's clear this is one of those innovations that's immediately both intuitive and invisible, and will eventually prove indispensable. It's at it's most convenient when you've got wet fingers, as that would usually result in many failed authentication attempts with Touch ID. However, it's at it's least convenient when wearing the darkest of sunglasses, as authentication fails more often than not (although it's fine with most sunglasses). While on the inconveniences, I've also found that touch-to-wake and raise-to-wake aren't worth the cost to battery life as the phone seems to keep waking while I'm walking around with it in my pocket. This was causing the battery to drain much faster than it should. In order to further optimise battery life I use Smart Invert to convert while backgrounds to black, as the OLED screen should be able to switch off any full-black pixels. Once enabled, triple-pressing the side button toggles it on and off so it's fast to disable it when you need to (it's only moderately ""smart"" so it still inverts the colours in most images).Coming from a 6 Plus, I much prefer the narrower, longer form factor of the X. It's a lot easier to use with one hand. The screen is also noticeably better, particularly viewing photos and videos. However, perhaps the most significant improvement is in the camera. While it struggles in low light, or zooming into long distance, in most situations it takes extremely good photos.Rather than bemoan the loss of the headphone jack, I've taken the opportunity to pair the iPhone X with BeatsX wireless earphones. Similar to the change from Touch ID to Face ID, now it's hard to imagine going back.Overall, the iPhone X is an amazing device. Given how much we rely on our smartphones, to me it's been well worth the investment.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"Don’t listen to what the tech review site says, this new Apple iPhone X has completely redesign not only what the new standard of edge to edge display should be on a phone but also the new way users interact with their smart phones.Apple sets the standard when they introduce the home button for the first smartphone in the world, and now they are first to introduce no home button for smart phone user interface. The new flow is also so much quicker because we no longer tap on the screen to perform action we now also swipe and slide which means the swipe up to go home is a natural flow.Face ID is also how the fastest way to unlock the phone and performing and ID verification. These two features are what sets this phone apart from the rest of the competitor and no doubt will be the new standard moving forward.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"It is certainly overpriced, especially considering that there is not many essential accessories in the box.Also, sometimes apps freeze and one has to restart the phone.The 5 watt charger that is included is sure underwhelming.The included lightning Earbuds are terrible. I have been throu six at least within a year. It seems that apple intentionally want people to pay for their wireless AirPods!! Their so-called Genius Bar is all dismissive about it!The face recognition technology is fairly great though.I would not really recommend Apple products anymore.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"The iPhone X definitely meets my expectations. It’s certainly a lot smaller than the 8 plus, but if you think about it the bezels are the size difference between the 8 plus and the X. Battery life is awesome, but it is my first day using it so I’ll see how it tapers off with use. Face ID works like a CHARM. Quick and easy. Very satisfied with Verizon’s network too, speedy and reliable. Overall I am one very happy satisfied customer!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Love it and try to ignore how much it cost.Purchased on vacation so sightless cheaper.After picking up old iPhone 6s the new screen feels worlds better on the new phone.While the new X is noticeably heavier than the 6s the new iPhone X feels more solid and looks super chic.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,So I have had my iPhone X for two months now and I love it.

iphone,4,"I just notice that sometimes the system froze. and i want to review the design of the physical phone. It is sometimes confusing which is top or bottom. Maybe i just used to the previous iphone style that there is a home button. Iphone x doesnt have home button but it screen design on top, the curve, for me is not good. I think it is better if the style of the top and bottom is the same. Just straight. I think they maximise the space.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"I had the iPhone 3, 4, 5 and then 6. I decided that was smart enough for a smart phone and I didn’t need any new phone. Temptation got the better of me and now I have the new iPhone X. Frankly I have no regrets. The new Face ID feature works great and apparently more secure than finger ID. With the Home button missing, it does take a little getting used to, but no more than couple of days. You don’t need to read extensive product manual to make the most of the phone. Just search on YouTube for top 10 iPhone X feature, and you will know most of what you need to know. The battery life is great (I understand it has two batteries packed inside) and the camera is great too. It has one of the fastest processor of any smart phone on the market and the latest OLED screen is really good. Just be careful you don’t drop the phone and crack the screen as it can set you back about $500. Is it value for money? I am not so sure about that. I think it’s a bit too pricey for a smart phone and for that reason I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"This is the first upgrade that really makes it worh your while. Face ID works flawlessly and the new OLED screen is amazing.The battery life has definitely improved as well.

iphone,4,I was really pleased that I held out for the Iphone X.  The camera is so much better and the photos look like they have been taken on a DSLR.  My only quibbles are the battery life and the price.  Hopefully the battery life will be improved with IOS updates.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,3,"$1.8K for a phone?I could build a great computer, buy a laptop or go on a great trip with that kind of money. But your are not here for that reason.You want to know whether the phone is worth the money and my answer is No.It's a great phone! but here's the thing, it's not worth the money. You are essentially getting an iPhone 8 plus in a smaller form factor.It's slower to use as the FaceID is still new and it's a 3 step process to unlock you phone instead of the 1 step to unlock with TouchID.Closing apps is a big pain in the but as you have to wait a few seconds to bring up the tabs and the hold again for a few seconds to bring up the close app icon.At least you know you won't turn off you phone accidentally though! it requires 2 buttons :PScreen is nice but viewing angle is not great compared to LCDs.The camera is super great! I love it for both video and photo.The call quality is pretty rubbish, where people on the receiving end hear you like you are living under water. Your mouth actually has to be almost touching the microphone area. Hopefully Apple figures this issue out asap as that's the primary function of the device.P.S. FaceID works with sunnies and in the dark ;)I'd say wait until next year where Apple has covered some R&D costs on the new form factor and lower the price of the new gen iphone.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"A great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous OLED screen. Rear telephoto camera outshoots the 8 Plus in low light, and the front camera snaps impressive portrait selfies. Face ID generally works fine. New interface and no home button mean major adjustments, and key features such as the Control Center are harder to reach and use. It’ll take time for most apps to be optimized for notched screen. The phone is hella expensive, and the all-glass design means a case and an insurance plan are musts.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"We own 2 of these (wife and I) and have owned Iphones from the very early days. ie: iphone 3 onwards. We didnt get the 6s or 7, instead moved from 6 & 6plus to two X's. I must say, this has definitely been their best so far. Like the saying goes, new brooms sweep well, although the new features and improvements over their previous models is remarkable. The face recognition is fantastic, so much quicker and gets even better with lots of apps adding the feature as time goes. Camera just blows everything out of the water. Even compares to my Nikon D5000 SLR, well almost ;). Always had friends hanging crap about their samsungs having a better camera, and yes they did, until the X came out. At least its now on par or even better in my opinion.One last thing, I hesitated quite a bit moving from a 6plus to this thinking I'll miss the size of screen. Not one bit, this screen is actually larger and the clarity so much better.",Productreview.com.au

iphone,5,"Love my new iPhone X. Was one of the lucky ones who got mine on pre-order, so no queuing up. Easy to setup and so much easier to use and intuitive compared to the 7 and 8 series models.

iphone,5,"Moving on from an iPhone 7, I already had a terrific phone and camera, but it's now gone to my other half. I waited a while for the new iPhone X (pronounced TEN) and I just love my new phone. I decided quite some time ago to travel without a camera, so was keen to move on to the dual lens iPhone X (but didn't want the extra size of a 7+ or 8+).I was initially slightly concerned about the lack of a home key or fingerprint scanner, but needn't have worried. The facial recognition is brilliant and almost instant, except very occasionally with too much back light. (It is certainly far more reliable than the fingerprint scanner. Of course you can still enter your PIN code if there is an issue.)A quick watch of a YouTube video taught me all I needed to know about the new gestures eg: accessing the control centre (diagonal wipe from the top right) - it is very easy to do everything without the home key, and I do not miss it AT ALL.For anyone struggling with it, watch a video and you won't miss the home button- good riddance to it.Some people don't like the ""notch"", (it's there for a reason -camera, face scanner etc) and I couldn't care less. Some people don't like change, if that were the case we'd all still be using the old Nokia Brick phones.The iPhone X is a bit different, but once you're used to it, you should love it, I do. You don't need a home button!(If you don't like change, buy an 8 or 8+, -but you'll be in the minority.)The phone works as it should, is super fast, the camera is brilliant, (LOVE the new portrait mode) I couldn't be happier with it whether photos or video. And if you're after a bit of fun there is always the  animojis which are very clever, (but of no real use!)",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,I've only had it a couple of weeks but loving it so far! The oled screen is amazing resolution with crisp display. The face recognition has been working great although I do miss the home button  bit. Takes some getting used to doing a screenshot by pressing volume up and power button. But overall very happy with it. Price point is too high though and they should make it more affordable in future models.,Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"The screen is really clear and it's easy to get used to the lack of the home button.  The Face Recognition ID is brilliant in placed of the fingerprint ID and it's a lot faster than the 6S it replaced.  However, the notch at the top of the screen is truly awful and you can no longer see the remaining battery percentage, without some mucking around.  Very expensive for what it is, especially for the small amount of storage it includes.  Overall it is ok, but not earth shatteringly good, needs work.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,4,"Great phone, was hard to get use to but it’s great once you do. The hey Siri function is brilliant. The only down fall is the screenshot function which was weird to get use as I randomly would take screenshots without my knowledge. The camera is fantastic too.

iphone,5,"I love this new iPhoneX big improvements from the older models ,it's much faster colours are brighter, camera is brilliant . It's a bit heavier than the older models but it just seems the perfect size .

It is very easy to adapt to from previous models, anything that you can't figure out immediately you can find instructions online.  The new photo features are great and allow you to take more interesting photographs. I love the size of the phone, being smaller than the plus versions yet have a larger screen.

iphone,3,"I purchased my iPhone X from Virgin mobile on a two year contract. I was looking forward to its arrival but was soon disappointed with this phone once I started to use it. The reason I have remained loyal to the Apple iPhone is because I enjoyed its easy and familiar interface since my first iPhone, the iPhone 4 but the iPhone X throws all the familiarities out the window. It’s like they changed things just for the sake of change and had a blatant disregard for the operators usability. The missing home button is painful and to do what was once simple has now become quite complicated, for example closing off apps on the iPhone X the user must slide up from the bottom of the screen, then hold their finger on the app and then close it off like they did with the ancient ios4 system. The reachability feature sucks and is far more complicated then the previous iPhones, the user must swipe from the bottom of the screen to lower the icons. I can only manage to get this right half the time and with the longer screen this feature is more important then ever. Then there is the screen quality, the screen has a yellow tint like it is stuck in permanent night mode. The facial recognition is temperamental and wastes time when it is working out if it is my face staring into the screen. They say the facial recognition lock is faster and more reliable then the fingerprint Touch ID but i found it to be the opposite. Especially because I like to hold my phone at waist height when I use it sitting down.There are some positives with the iPhone X, the battery life exceeded my expectations. The camera quality is great and the new full screen is nice but it’s not enough to keep me loyal. After years of loyalty this will probably be my last iPhone purchase ever.

iphone,5,"The newest iPhone model is exactly what I've always wanted. It's super fast, it's sleek and beautiful. The screen is on another level, and to top it off... Facial recognition (Face ID). Face ID is a huge part of the phone which works perfectly without you doing anything. You literally just look at your phone.The phone itself is a perfect size and the battery is the longest lasting of any previous iPhone I have had. This might have something to do with the new OLED screen, which is stunning.Without a home button, there are a few new things to get the hang of, but it will happen pretty quickly. This also makes it feel more like a new phone as it's not the same old thing as the predecessors. All in all, I recommend this iPhone as it's an exceptional device.",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,"What a beautiful phone! It's got glass on the back, so it is a bit heavy, but you get used to it after a while. The animated emoji function is really cute, neat and entertaining.

You won't regret purchasing this phone!",Productreview.com.au
iphone,5,Best phone I have ever had. The home button may be gone but takes no time to adjust to the new ways and this is from a 53 year old. Face ID works really well even when wearing someone else’s glasses. The OLED screen is a cracker being vibrant and crystal clear. Some competitors may be brighter but then they start looking fake. Battery life is ok and must say that is the only thing that hasn’t improved. Amazes me that a high tech company like Apple can’t do bettter in this regard. Camera takes awesome shots in any conditions. Portrait mode produces great results with a definite wow factor. I also love the wireless charging and the Mophie charger I picked up from Apple works a treat. Can’t wait for the update  that will give wireless charging a boost. A bigger screen and only a little bigger than the iPhone 7/8 is a real winner. Much has been said about the notch but must admit don’t even notice it. Dissapointing how expensive the phone is and in particular the way Apple treat Australia where it is even more expensive than the rest of the world. Finally you get flawless and fast performance. Great looking and high quality phone and most probably the best on the market.,Productreview.com.au

galaxy,4,"I picked up the phone on release day to see if there was much of the same from previous iterations of the galaxies or if Samsung actually listened to their customers. Well I'm here to tell you they've done a great job.



Pros:

-Screen - The screen is the best in the business. Colors are beautifully saturated with enough brightness in direct sunlight as well as good viewing angles. HDR content looks phenomenal as expected also.

-Design - Although I'm not a fan of glass on glass phones this is still a beautifully designed phone and appreciate the taming of the curved screen in comparison to the S7 and S8.

-Speakers - Wow, the speakers are phenomenal! I prefer front facing speakers like in the Pixel 2 but these are definitely one of the best sounding stereo pair I've heard. At max volume it starts to sound a bit tinny but I don't play my music or movies at max volume anyways.

-Fingerprint Sensor - I'm glad Samsung listened to their customers and changed the placement of the fingerprint sensor. It's far more accurate than last years S8 and the setup was done in no time as well.

-Camera- The camera on the galaxy s9 is an absolute beast. Colors are punchy and detailed and the variable aperture can really shine in low light scenarios. Low light photos outclass the Pixel 2 especially with noise reduction. Selective focus is a bit wonky with edge detection from time to time but still manages to produce great images the majority of the time.



Cons:

-Battery Life - Battery life is probably the worst thing about this phone. I'm a light to medium user and average about 24 hours on a charge. Although the battery is perfectly fine for my usage I can see how a heavy user might not make it throughout the day. I understand Samsung's point of view on being safe with the battery capacity due to the fiasco with the Note 7, but they could have put a greater capacity or optimized the battery better. I've gotten better battery out of my Essential phone which is comparable in screen size and battery capacity. 



Conclusion:



Overall, I think the Samsung Galaxy S9 is a great buy for someone that is looking for a complete package of power and performance. If you're a Samsung fan or need to upgrade from an old phone and want the latest and greatest then it's a no brainer. If you're looking for a near stock android experience with quick updates then this phone isn't for you. I hope this is the year Samsung finally gets their update scheduled worked out to provide customers with fast OS and security patches in a timely fashion.",BestBuy
galaxy,3,"I have a very annoying obsession with trying new phones wherein I switch between android to iOS phones about once a year. With that said, there are things I like about both operating systems and this is not my first switch between the two. Hence, I recently picked up a new unlocked Galaxy S9 for my latest venture. This phone is sleek, classy and absolutely beautiful. Additionally, it’s very speedy and has very smooth operation. The camera is of very high quality, too. Better than my current iPhone 7 Plus in many respects. 



HOWEVER, I found that the cell and WiFi reception of the S9 was insufficient for my needs and it was subpar to my iPhone using the same nano sim in both phones as well as the same WiFi connections. Granted, where I am located is somewhat spotty at times for cell connection, but it would not pull in the signal as well as the iPhone. In the same exact areas using the same exact SIM card I can consistently get one to two bars of LTE with the iPhone, but the S9 struggled to acquire any type of signal and quite often would fail. The same applied when trying to connect to the AT&T hot spot in my truck. I tested the S9 with both T-Mobile and AT&T and got the same results. 



When you’re in an area with very strong cell coverage you probably won’t have any issues, but when cell coverage is slim you may have serious difficulties. I ended up returning the S9 in the end and eating the $35 restocking fee rather than have a beautiful new phone that I couldn’t use for its basic and primary purpose...data and talking. Had it met those basic needs, I’d give it 5 stars. I wish I could strongly recommend the beautiful S9, but I can’t. Maybe you’ll have better luck.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"I haven't owned a Samsung device since the Samsung Infuse 4g. Over the years I've jumped between One Plus, Motorola, and the Nexus line. My most recent was the Moto Z play which I owned for a couple years. That coupled with the Moto Mod battery pack, would last 3 days on battery. It was nice, but with the older SD620, it was definitely getting slow. Camera wasn't great at all, and to top it off, the screen shattered on me. I walked into BB looking for a phone, planning on getting the Moto X4, but wasn't so sure about it especially since it is almost 2 years old. I knew the S9 was going to be phased out soon, so I took a peak at that, and noticed it just went on sale for $100 off. I wasn't looking to spend $620 on a phone that day, but I did it.



First, the UI of the phone is nice. It isn't as bad as what I remember hearing about the old TouchWiz. It's not laggy, and easy to use. Bixby home isn't too bad, but the bixby assistant leaves something to be desired. I've downloaded an app to remap the Bixby button (can't be done in the OS), but it has disabled the bixby home. Hopefully this might be something that can be released in a future update, but as far as I know about the track record of Samsung updating the OS I don't expect that to happen ever. 



What was nice to see is Samsung has a similar feature to Motorola's always on display. You can get a quick glance of what your notifications are while your phone is locked, without revealing too much information.



The phone has an IRIS scanner that works great for extra security, though I wish it would require you to blink to be able to unlock it. Even in a very dark room it's easy to unlock. Now the fingerprint sensor, I do wish that it was on the front of the phone rather than the back. I run into situations, often, where my phone is sitting on my desk and I want to unlock it real quick, but the fingerprint sensor on the back requires me to pick the phone up. I know, first world problems, but it would be nice to have.



The battery life isn't too bad. With the phones FHD+ screen, and always on display, I have been able to squeeze a day and a half out of a full charge. This could be better if I didn't have a bunch of applications running in the background.



Now the camera is excellent. I've always had phones with ok cameras. The moto z play had a terribly crap camera. The camera on the S9 compared to the Z Play was a difference of night and day (seriously, low light pictures come out great). The front facing camera is also very good. Excellent for doing video calls.



Definitely a great phone, but not perfect. If it weren't on sale, I probably wouldn't have purchased the S9, but for an extra $100 off, I believe it was worth it.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"To be sincere, I was very skeptical about buying this phone because I had heard a LOT of bad reviews about it. Too many to be honest, so i was between buying this one, the Note 9 or wait for S10 which comes this year. I was even thinking about going for my second favorite brand that is LG.

Furthermore, I gave in and i was hoping I was getting my money's worth, and i can say I did. My S7 was a sharm, i loved my phone so much, It lasted me about two years if I am not mistaken, I was only hoping my S9 was an upgrade and not a downgrade which thankfully it was an upgrade. The screen is slightly taller, and the ohone it is thinner which i do enjoy. I thought i was going to have a problem with not having the home button at the front, but in reality, it doesn't take much getting used to. I also thought I was going to take some getting used to with the fingerprint on the back, but that wasn't a problem either. Love the graphics of the phone and LOVE the battery life most of all! My phone lasts all day and I use my phone frequently. Speakers are great as well, i love that it's pretty loud. No problem with hearing other people either and also no problem with connecting it to my fitbit or any Bluetooth device I own.

I also love the fact that my phone has 64gb internally and I can still add an SD card to my phone.

Phone is super responsive, no problems at all with that and has not frozen on me or rebooted by itself like my S7 started to do (it was old). I definetely recommend this phone.

I don't know to what extent did other people used their phones that they didn't like it or love it for that matter, but i believe it's a great phone. Maybe because I never owned the S8 so I cannot tell the difference. Great phone over all.",BestBuy
galaxy,3,"Switched from using Iphone's to this. 



Here are just a few things that I don't like:

When you receive a text message you can either have it set to show who the message was from and what the message says or you can have it set to say Text Message, meaning when someone texts you it just shows you that you have a text message. So you don't know who text you. This bugs me very much because on my Iphone when someone texts me, it would say who the message was from. Then I could determine if it was something I should view right away or if it was just a spam message (like from a sale from cherry berry).



The next thing that bugs me is the ringtone, notification tone, media, and system are all separate volume controls, which usually would be nice. However, you would think ringtone would me from a call and text message and it's not it is strictly phone calls. They lumped text messaging into notifications. So now if you want to turn your text message volume up you have to here all your notification tones. I have shut most of them off, but I still like getting notifications from some and there is no way to just turn the volume off on those. So the phone will randomly makes noises if I have the notification volume up and half the time I cannot figure out what the sound is for.



One more thing, when I try to send a video to someone it won't let me because it is to big. I am only trying to send a short little 1 minute video and I believe the biggest I can send is 15 seconds. This is just ridiculous to me. I can't send send a partial of a video without cutting the video down to size loosing the rest of the video completely.



Also the keyboard on this phone really sucks. I know you can change it but, it is set up the same way on the iPhone and it just adds random letters or words or doesn't type the word.



I know it has taken some time getting used to this versus an IPhone but there are just those couple things that almost make me want to switch back.

galaxy,4,"This is my first unlocked smartphone buy in USA. The sales person was real honest and explained me about the product details/offers. I used lyca prepaid sim (lyca uses T-mobile network) and it started working instantly. Data speed is high. Don't know if this phone will work in India, experiment that in the next month during my vacation, hope this will work with the networks in India as well. So far this phone works great. It was 38% when I bought this mobile, the whole night i played around the options and settings (got a little eye pain may be i have to adjust the resolution or contrast) and after 5 hours the mobile started getting little heat, i will continue to monitor the performance of the mobile for the next 14 days.



pros: current phone with almost all options, good camera. Got a freebie of Home monitoring kit, dont know how to use it but will give a try this weekend.. :)

cons: phone is getting heat after 3-hrs. Compare this model with Samsung.com. With samsung online, you could save some 60-70$ bcos there is no tax charged. I should have done this thru Samsung site, I thought I could save some dollars by going with Best Buy Credit Card. But no much difference becos of the Tax. So, unless you get big rewards or discounts, dont go for Best Buy credit cards, thats waste of time and one additional unnecessary hard credit check. 5% reward back, 25% accessory/other bundle offers...STILL the Tax amount you have to pay to BestBuy will be more than the savings.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"I have always had Samsung since the smart phones began. My S7 was damaged and the insurance had expired. After checking the prices, the S9 was only $100 more than the S7. It is all right so far, a lot I need to learn before I can say for sure. There are a few things I do not care for.



I do not like the the home or back buttons on the screen. Nor do I like the way you send a call. No more just finding the name and swiping to the right. I guess I will get use to it. If not I have 30 days to exchange it for another S7. 



The camera was rated high on the reviews, which was one reason I went with the S9. I am not impressed. I can see a small difference in the quality. Maybe once I read and experiment with it, that will change also. Do not care for the way the picture folders are setup, nor being notified when contacts update their pictures. Too personal and I will change that once I figure it out.



Had to make changes to get it to connect to my Sony Android TV. Though the websites said they were not comparable. Started to return it before I researched it. 



The search and download speed is a bit faster, but the upload speed is a bit slower than the S7. I am just getting use to the apps button being replaced with swiping upward. 



And finally this Bixby thing keeps trying to turn itself on, after I disabled it.



I have only had it for a few days so maybe I am speaking to soon. But I will update my review once I decide.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I purchased this phone with high expectations and they have been met.

Though I originally thought to buy it new I ended up going with the open-box excellent option and have NOT been disappointed.

True to their title the phone was in excellent condition and I personally couldn't and still can't find a single bit of damage. It was essentially brand-new; but considerably cheaper.



All that aside the phone runs great and has soo many useful (for me) features in comparison to my previous Samsung, the S5 Active. That thing was long overdue for a replacement and I couldn't have asked for much more out of one at the price.

I wish they would have included the second rear camera on the smaller version as the 9+ was just too big to me; but that isn't a deal breaker.



The camera is Amazing and so is the screen.

With pictures I wish I could take pictures larger than 4:3 without compromising picture quality; but that's a limitation of a 12mp camera I suppose.



And then there is YouTube which like most all video apps or video players won't fill in the entire screen due to most all video today being shot in a 16:9 aspect ratio; whereas i believe this phone has a 18.5:9 ratio.

You can zoom in on YouTube thankfully, however it does cut the image off a bit.

Battery - 

 I am getting excellent battery life. I have used it on long rides and have been getting 8 to 10 hours of display time. Enough to last me through the day. I don't find myself needing to reach for a charger until it gets very late at night.



-Dex

Dex is greatly underrated. I am a teacher given a 6 year old laptop to use for work. I instead got a monitor and cable. I can do everything from writing in word to grading papers. Grabbing my phone when I leave reduced my amount I had to carry around to just a phone. 



- Samsung tweaks

The tweaks samsung does only add to the experience of the phone. Not only can I ""cast"" my phone screen to my chromecast/android Tv at home, I can with other devices. Granted some of these devices are samsung branded devices. I found my Microsoft wireless display adapter I got for my surface works with my phone. 



Some of the tweaks I don't care much about can be shut off. I didn't care for the edge screens. Without much effort they got shut off. Anything that I don't like can be changed or tweaked. Want to swap the back and app view, no problem. Want to download a theme to change to make them look more ""android"" no problem. Want to change the colors of the notification quick access no problem.

galaxy,5,"I'm just going to say it, I absolutely 100% love this phone. I had a Pixel 2, which is a great device, but unfortunately it took a dive and was broken.

It is fast, responsive, the screen is outrageously gorgeous, and it has everything an Android User could need. 



I would say, for first-time Android users it could come with a difficulty curve especially if you're coming from Apple, but it'll just take some time to master the phone. A lot of people take swings at Samsung's ""bloatware"" but I've honestly enjoyed many of the apps they load the phone with. Samsung Internet is great and secure, and if you have to switch into Secret Mode (Their version if incognito) you can set it to require a password or your fingerprint for extra security (and requires you to do it again should you move from that screen). The other apps have been great and helpful: Samsung health, for working out or managing diet, or even their base messenger app, which I believe works pretty well. 



I would say if you've been interested in Samsung or unsure, go check out a preview model at your local BestBuy/Service Provider. It's a great phone and is wonderfully crafted. Great job, Samsung, I believe you have another faithful buyer if you keep up the quality that this phone brings!",BestBuy

Recently I decided apple wants just way too much for their products so I started comparing the specs of the S9 to the iPhone XS.

I was expecting a nice phone when it arrived but it exceeded all of my expectations. Not only is the phone aesthetically pleasing but it also has the nicest screen of any phone I've handled. The part that I was nervous about was the app store, and I can safely say that Google play has just about every single app you can find on the apple app store. Anyone who is looking to switch from apple I honestly recommend the S9 it will blow you away. And I had the opportunity to compare the iPhone XS Max to the Galaxy S9 because a family member bought the iPhone at the same time I bought this Galaxy S9. Everybody has an opinion in this world but I honestly like the S9 way more now that I've had a few weeks to compare the two.

I don't use bestbuy enough these days because I don't have one close enough, but I remember why I used to love shopping in store.",BestBuy
galaxy,1,"Overall this phone seems like a noticable improvement over my galaxy s5 active. However, the unlocked version does not work with the service provider features. I have AT&T and so far have found the voicemail app, wifi calling, and push to talk app not compatible. I literally wasted 7 hours with At&t phone tech support, and went to the store to get help. Finally a tech support agent told me the unlocked phones don't work with everything. Additionally, the S9 bought as the At&t $800 version is not compatible with push to talk yet. I even went to the verison store to see if features would work if I switched service providers. They have the same issues with unlocked phones. It is a good concept to buy unlocked, but, clearly the providers want you to buy their overpriced versions of the same phone. 



I gave this phone 1 star because the camera is nice, and battery seems to last long. Other than that for basic use, there was not much point in upgrading.",BestBuy
galaxy,1,"I bought 2 Samsung Galaxy S9 back in March from Samsung.com. 

My first issue was when they charged me for my exchanged S7 device that they claimed had physical damage but from the pictures they provided showed nothing more than normal wear. Calling and calling did no good to get anything done and just run around in circles. They couldn't even provide the IMEI of the returned device to prove it was even the one that I sent to them. 

I went to sell my Samsung Galaxy S9 because I was so mad from this experience. I sold the phones that should have been unlocked since I paid full price for the phones. But the phones were locked to T-Mobile and T-Mobile couldn't unlock them. I called Samsung and they couldn't unlock the phones either sending me in circles. I asked the reps why they would send me a phone I paid full price for locked and why they wouldn't unlock the phone. 

Samsung has the worst customer service and I highly recommend getting a Google Pixel or another Android device.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"There isn't much of a difference between my S7 and my S9. There are features on the camera that allow me to do different things but not to the point where I would waste money on it again if I had to choose to wait for the S10. I purchased the S9 because my S7 had horrible battery life and the operating system was so slow. The phone is much lighter and smaller than the S7. The unlock feature with my face is an interesting feature because there are times when I want to just check the time and my phone unlocks without me wanting it to. Also,the biometrics are on the back of the phone unlike the S7 where it was the home key, so that took a little bit getting used too. Again I stress that the camera isn't a significant upgrade from the S7, you could tell there was improvement but I again would wait for the S10 to come out. The Bixby button on the side is useful,I don't use it for much, it isn't as useful as one would think but the bottom doesn't get in the way.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,Galaxy S9 is very similar to my old galaxy S8 with a few improvements. Easy to upgrade from galaxy S8 with the Samsung Sync and their cable. Just make sure on many apps you login and save your status because not all your data will be moved over unless it's saved in the apps account.,BestBuy
galaxy,5,"Don't let the outside fool you into thinking that nothing has changed. The S9 is incredible. Loaded with power, efficiencies and features, it will take your breath away! Nearly everything about it can be customized to match your taste and how you want to work and play. The S9 is the new standard for mobile.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I had an S7 and had to upgrade due to it not charging, staying charged or the cords wanting to stay in. I had no choice but to buy the unlocked phone outright, but it's been great so far. I love the facial recognition option to unlock the phone. Phone's battery is great so far. I really like it.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"I really like the phone, the camera is amazing, all the features. The screen resolution is great. The only problem with this phone is the battery. Drains too fast, I seriously don't understand, why one of Samsung's best signature series phone would have a battery life this short.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I have owned other Samsung phones starting with the SIII and liked them all, but I love the S9 phone! It's the best phone I have ever owned. All the features are great, especially the curved screen, and the camera is fantastic. It's larger than my S4, S5 or S6, so the dimensions are perfect for viewing texts and videos.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,The Samsung galaxy s9 is a great phone. I got the unlocked version and I love that you can add a micro sd card to expand the 64gb of memory. The only problem is it says I have a voicemail when I don’t but I believe this is a service provider problem rather than a phone problem.,BestBuy
galaxy,2,"I bought an unlocked version due to Best Buy not having any AT&T models in stock, they told me all features would work. Not all features from AT&T will work on the unlocked model, like wifi calling or visual voice mail. Stick with an AT&T phone if you want all features to work.",BestBuy

galaxy,5,"First I wanted a cell phone with a super camera and I made the right pick, the pictures and videos the S9 takes are really nice.

galaxy,4,I upgraded from a Samsung Note 3. I considered the S9+ but really like the size of this phone. It's actually narrower than my old phone. It's a major upgrade from my old phone.

galaxy,5,"I love my Samsung Galaxy S9. It is easy to use and was very easy to transfer files from my old phone to this one. At first I thought I should have bought the S9+ because the phone felt small in my hand, but once I got a case for it it feels fine. I highly recommend this phone.",BestBuy

galaxy,5,"Great phone, easy to transfer all my files, pictures, vids apps and log ins automatically. The only issue was the Sim card from my S5 was a different size, so I had to go to the Verizon Store and get a new one. If you go to the corporate store, they will do it for free.",BestBuy

New 645 processor seems lightning fast and now can disable Bixby in settings to avoid accidental touch. I'm not sure what else you could want in a phone. I use unlocked version on tmobile and works great. Yes wifi calling works perfectly. I traded a pixel 2 and the hardware on Samsung is superior. I like pure android also but Samsung has done a great job on their little unique functions. Excellent lte reception. Buy a nice protective case as phone is beautiful and fragile on both sides. Memory expansion and headphone jack make a very good product better.",BestBuy
galaxy,2,"The Phone is Samsung which up till now I thought was ""ahead of the curve"" in features and performance. The Display is Bright and clear. The Camera takes really nice pictures. Thats the upside. The downside is. The battery life is a joke. I mean it isn't adequate. I mean it seems like it runs out of Gas super fast, SUPER FAST. The keyboard is tiny, it is Really really small and very hard to type on. Forget about responsible texting and driving. Even the Smallest message requires 120% concentration and you will get into an accident. And ""Bixby""...BIXBY and that stupid activation key are so annoying the second thing you do with the phone is youtube how to disable Bixby AFTER charging the tiny battery. You would be a fool to not get an extended warrenty because the battery is gonna die a minute after the factory warrenty is up. Samsung, you got me on this. NEVER AGAIN Samsung",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I had an s7 that was lagging and getting to the end of its line. I had it for 3 years. Im not a android fanboy or apple either. Ive had both phones and enjoy them just as much. The reason I decided to stick with samsung was because I wanted the headphone jack and ability to expand my memory. I dont think the iphone or any phone for that matter is worth 1000. The iphone Xr was also in my books, but with this phone I get a more manageable size 5.8 and get the nice screen. The phone is really fast and handles all my apps. I use it daily and get enough battery to get me through the day. If you are looking for a phone I really recommend this one or the s9 plus if you want something a little bigger. Maybe now wait a little because samsung will announce their new phones next month, meaning these might drop in price.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"Although it is not my IDEAL phone (I hope that it eventually will be possible to get a super reliable plain Android phone, like a reliable Pixel) I can recommend this phone to anyone not bothered by Samsung custom software. I do development to some extent so I look for phones that aid me with that. Samsung takes an approach where they go ahead and substantially develop tools and apps for their devices. Example: Bixby is the assistant (think Suri or Cortana). The settings, and user interface (UI) is custom designed by Samsung. That said, the Galaxy S9 is a great phone. The camera is very good, it has micro SD expansion and a headphone jack. The screen is very good. Battery life has not been a problem. The sound output is good l. I do not do gaming but I imagine that the phone would be fine for all but the most demanding games. It has relatively new processors and adequate memory.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I actually bought this about a month ago. And wanted to get some use in before posting any kind of review. The phone I owned before this was a 4+ year old Motorola Droid Turbo. And it was starting to show its age. So yes I was way overdue for a smartphone upgrade. So this phone was my tax refund treat for myself this year and it was worth every penny paid for it. Battery life has been amazing ending the day averaging in the 45-50% area. And this for moderate usage (games, music, web browsing). I haven't had too much time yet to play around yet with the camera yet on this. But if all the reviews are correct I am gonna really like it. So unless you are a diehard fan of the note or are just looking for a good samsung phone. Don't hesitate on pulling the trigger on this phone it is definitely worth it.",BestBuy
galaxy,3,"I moved to this phone from my Blackberry Priv and the phone is working like a champ except for one thing that is extremely troubling. That is email. In the past when I reviewed my email on the phone, I could delete the email from my phone but still leave it in my server inbox. This phone, no matter how I tried to set it up, does not allow me to do that. Doing it this way allowed me to not clutter my phone with old email but only look at the new email as it came in. Later on when at my computer I could review and reply intelligently instead of using the micro keyboards on the phone. I'll try again some day, but I am not looking so happy about the prospect. Below I had to select whether or not I would recommend and the answer truly is based on what the friend is looking for so don't go hog wild because I said Yes.",BestBuy

Camera: I am a big fan of the camera because the quality of the pictures is amazing. And that is one of the reasons that I wanted this phone in the beginning.

Speed: the phone runs very well and fast. I dont really know processing and stuff but I've had the phone for a month now and have been running a lot of things at once.

Battery: it is amazing how well the battery holds a charge. I can go the whole night without charging the phone and will still be pretty decent and ready to go in terms of charge for the next day. Battery will last me mostly the entire day with normal use.

Extra: I have a really fun time figuring out the phone things the phone has to offer. The storage space on the phone is really good. Sorry I couldn't add a picture but I'm using the phone to write the review.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"Upgraded from a Galaxy S5 Active, and I'm not sure I don't like my old one better. I'm not a big tech-ie so I basically need my phone to just make calls, text, and e-mail. Not a big fan of the curved screen so far either. Makes it somewhat difficult to find a quality case with good screen protection. The extras on the S9 are awesome if you're into that sort of thing such as camera quality, upgraded photo and video features, new emojis and .gifs. The stereo speaker makes the sounds extremely clear and the music is awesome. Wireless charging available. My only real disappointment is the lack of options with text messages. You cannot change background colors or font as with my old S5 Active without installing a separate app, nor can you set individual text tones for contacts. One tone for all. Overall an awesome phone though and I hope I get used to it soon. Would definitely recommend.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"Another great flagship phone from Samsung. I had purchased Samsung S8 last year and bought this one for a family member, this year. A year without an issue with my Samsung S8 encouraged me to get this new version this time. Samsung has really improved the hardware and software in past couple of year. I am looking forward to get One UI from Samsung to be available on this phone soon. So far, a month or two using this phone, I have not heard any complaint from the family member who is using this phone. This phone has all the latest tech that you can find in the competitors (Apple) phone, plus expandable storage, Iris scanner, and more. Highly recommend to someone who want to switch from iPhone and experience the fun of using Android OS.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"After owning this S7 and going straight to the S9, I am glad I skipped the S9. One of newest features I enjoy using on this is the retina scanner to unlock your phone, and even the samsung pass option that will auto-fill your passwords using just the retina scanner. I don't get much use from the finger print reader. The battery life is not much of an improvement on the S7, I'd even say they are nearly the same in terms of use-time. The physical difference between S7 and S9 is nearly identical too, but the S9 will feel and look slimmer because of the edgeless screen. In reality it doesn't take up any less space in your hand or pocket. All in all, it was a good upgrade if you are on a two year phone cycle. Will I skip the Galaxy 10? Probably.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"Bought the Samsung Galaxy S9 because my beloved S5 was slowly dying. If you haven't used and S8 or 9, here's a little tutorial regarding saving pictures onto your SD card in separate albums...with the S5, you clicked the 3 dots in upper right corner and the menu dropped to allow select, then move. Not so on the S9. To move pictures, you press ""firmly"" on chosen picture, then you can select others to go with it, then the 3 dots, which will show the move section on menu. Not trying to talk down to any one reading this, I am not that tech savvy and wanted to spare anyone else the frustration.

galaxy,5,"I love my samsung galaxy 9, with all its glory and faults. 1st off, I love how the battery holds its charge throughout the day. I had an iPhone 6 before and it was not able to hold a charge for more than 4 to 5 hours. Also, I got a deal for this phone where Best Buy gave us 128 GB more storage and a wireless charger, in addition to the phone which makes me a very happy mama, since I take so many photos and videos. It is easy to use, awesome camera with ar emoji capabilities, and syncing it with Google is incredible. Some of the features I don't like is how sensitive the screen is and settings/applications can be so easily accessed if you're not careful (read: have curious kids). However, with it being waterproof and all, this is definitely one of the best phones I have ever had and am very happy with my purchase.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"My primary motivation for upgrading this phone were 2: (1) I had a second SIM card for a second line, and needed a phone to put it in, and (2) I've been using the Galaxy S phones since about the S4, not missing an upgrade year, and so far i've been happy with them. To be honest, I do not notice THAT much different than the S8+ besides maybe security/sign-in options, however because Samsung only promises maybe one or two major operating system upgrades per phone model, if you want the latest operating system, it seems you always need to upgrade at some point. Unrelated, but I may trade my old S8+ for an iPhone on my second (older) line as it is possible this will allow me to develop applications targeted and tested to both IOS and Android, which was part of original motivation for getting two SIM cards to begin with.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"Phone is about 1 month old. The purchase of this phone was a big upgrade for me. I had a $70 LG prior to this but needed something faster as I was just promoted to a management position.



Pros: Google Maps seems to work faster, so does the text message app. Nice speakers. Charges fast and long battery life.



Cons: Lately when I am doing something, the page or app I am on freezes and I have to hit the back button in order to use the keyboard/continue on the page; this happens several times a day. I have also been noticing the keyboard not fully appearing or disappearing. This phone comes with ""Bixby"", essentially a Siri, but it sucks and cannot understand me or my commands in any simple manner.



Overall recommend.",BestBuy
galaxy,1,"Going back to my iPhone. I had a lot of hope for this, but I was disappointed with the facial recognition only working in certain light conditions which made just getting into the phone a cumbersome process, the bluetooth connection to my fitbit and my home lock was weak and delayed and sometimes did not work without reset. Weak bluetooth compared to my iPhone which always just works. The curved screen causes extended case costs. If all a curved screen does is look nice and cost more, that doesn't justify getting a phone with a curved screen! The wireless charging is terrible. The phone has to be out of it's case and placed on the charger just right or it doesn't charge or charges on and off and makes a lot of annoying noise. I got to the point, after only 3 days, I had to take it back.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"My almost 2 year old 6p was shutting down with 80% battery left and so I was in the market for a new phone already. They're getting more and more expensive and needing to replaced way too quickly now. That said, I'm pretty happy with the new S9. Best Buy had a pretty good deal on an unlocked S9 for $700 that came with a wireless charger and a 128GB SD card. Still expensive, but didn't hurt quite as bad.



The Nexus 6p is a pretty large phone so I was really happy that the S9 is able to have the same screen size as the 6p but the phone is still a lot smaller than the 6p. That was the hardest thing to get used to about the 6p.

galaxy,5,"So I just joined the 21st century with this purchase... my first cell phone. I got it to replace a land line that was more expensive than a cell phone. So as a replacement phone, it's great, I'm saving money, it's always with me (great for car emergencies for example#, has an ""answering machine"" built into it, contacts etc... The benefit is the extra work the devices can do. Love having a camera handy #although it is pretty limited in nature compared to the pro level camera equipment) ....

I really didnt look into the capability nor the specs of the S9, just went to the store, picked it up, and went with it. After 3 weeks of use I can that this is the best phone I have ever had. The battery lasts at least 2 days before I have to charge it, and that is without having the power saving on, and I use my phone heavily. The camera takes amazing pictures and the screen resolution is fantastic. It is water resistant, very fast, super light, and it looks amazing. There are too many functions to list them. I would recommend this phone to a friend.",BestBuy

I've had the phone maybe 3 weeks now and within the first week it had tiny scratches on the screen and I never put the phone on or near anything for it to happen.

galaxy,5,"I bought this phone for a family member during the Black Friday sale. It was an upgrade from a Note 5. The phone comes with a cable that allows all the data from a previous Samsung phone to be transferred to the new phone. It worked like a charm. All the contacts, photos, and videos transferred smoothly. So far, no problem was encountered with the phone.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,Getting this phone was so easy! All I did was change my sim card over and then use smart switch and it was like I had my old phone back but with a lot of upgrades. I didn't have to spend two weeks being frustrated learning how to use a new phone. It was user friendly and had well-timed and helpful tutorials to help me learn about the latest features.,BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I absolutely love my new phone, have had service on it for a week now and have had zero problems. I bought the unlocked version to connect to Straight talk and had no issues there. The camera is really nice and the curved screen is really cool but does take alittle time to get used to. Overall I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone :)",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"I love Sansung products. I am still learning how to use this phone the S9. So far it's been great using it. It has some great features on it. Bixby, facial recognition, hand signals for selfies etc. I'm excited to learn all the features. The only reason it did not get 5 stars is because I have not used all the features yet.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I bought this on the Black Friday deal that got me $200 off on the original price. Samsung is actually doing a great job with improving their phones. If you are the person who likes to be up-to-date with the lastest technologies, start with this phone. It's a great phone to have. Just don't drop it. I recommend a good drop proof case with this.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"We bought this phone on Black Friday. Good price and the phone is working great. Only thing you should know is an unlocked phone does not give you all the features that ""branded"" phones give you. An example: a T-Mobile phone gives T-mobile customers the ability to video talk with other T-Mobile phones. Unlocked phones do not have this feature.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"This phone has one of the best cameras I've seen in a smartphone. It has been an easy transition up from my S5. It's been fun to experiment with and I haven't had to ask for any help yet. My only negative is having no changing weather pictures on the home screen. Also my ring tone did not transfer over, but that is minor.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,The phone has an awesome look and feels great in the hand. The display when set to the highest settings its beautiful especially with 4k videos playing! The camera is better than most! Only complaint is but this might be my fault is the infinity display although beautiful since it curves I accidentally push things when holding the phone,BestBuy
galaxy,4,"I got this phone because of the amazing camera. It is slightly smaller than the S9+, so it fits in my pocket better. The main (and enormous drawback) is that it is Android and so its security totally sucks. Of course Google is tracking every keystroke so that ads are on websites that are tailored towards the user. I hate ""big brother""!",BestBuy
galaxy,4,Been a while since I started using my S9 and have been really happy with my S9. Upgraded from iphone as the new ones got real costly and no regrets. It's a great phone. Fast and the camera is really cool. And the best I can just add a real in expensive Memory card and get tons of memory. All in all much staisfied with my decision.,BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I have never been one for the new gadget out. I had a grand prime phone before and needed more ram on the phone. Best buy had this phone on sell, and was very helpful it helping me set this up. My provider told me only a certain serial number would work. Best buy told me I would have no problem with this unlocked phone. They were correct. Very helpful even after the sale of phone.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I upgraded from a Galaxy Note 5, a device that I've had for a few years and I absolutely love my new Galaxy S9. It feels right in the hand, the fingerprint sensor location is well thought out and it's very snappy. Android Oreo works well. The only issue I have is with Bixby, which almost never understands me or never does what I ask it to do, so I use Google assistant instead.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"My Galaxy S5 has had issues for some time with short battery life and it seemed like I was always having to swap out batteries 1-2 times daily. Saw a good price and what I wanted at BB and with Christmas around the corner, it was hard not to go for the S9 with all the positive reviews on Consumer Reports.Time will tell!!!!",BestBuy
galaxy,5,I had a Galaxy S7 before I purchased this phone and feel amazed by how much faster and smooth this runs comparatively. My old phone was 2 years old but just the sheer amount of new features built on top of the faster phone made it more than worth the tag price. The sound and video quality upgrade are just icing on the cake,BestBuy
galaxy,5,"The phone has all the latest features from a sharp camera to a new feature that mimics Seri, and called Buxby. It operates at speeds much faster than my s7edge. The only drawback I have found is that the cord for charging has a new camera plug that is different than either the standard android cord or the standard iPhone cord.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"Gifted this to my brother and he is super happy..

I myself have been using S8 for more than a year and so, I readily liked S9. 



Pros that I can list are:

- Good display

- Good performance

- Good battery life



Haven't yet heard of any complaints for S9 from my brother.



Totally happy with this purchase.",BestBuy
galaxy,5,We were looking to replace a phone and wanted it to be the lateset and greatest as we tend to hold onto these things a long time. In the world of Android that meant the Samsung Galaxy S9. Every amazing thing they say about this phone is true. To date we're completely satisfied with the decision to purchasae this phone and anticipate many years of good use.,BestBuy
galaxy,1,"With use of a case, the phone cannot sustain a fall of 42 inches. The glass will crack.

If you don't want to pay for half the phone to fix small cracks, you can try repairing it yourself and break all internal components, when you fail, Samsung will refuse to repair it, even though you are offering them money.

So, if you have a 100% chance of not dropping the phone...",BestBuy
galaxy,5,"I've only had it a few weeks but having fun learning all the things that I can do with this phone. I've been on hikes and walks to shoot some Spring scenes and try out all the settings, especially Pro shots. A few problems because the power button is directly across from the volume buttons and it's easy to accidentally do a reset so be careful. It's due to the slender width.",BestBuy
galaxy,4,"I finally upgraded from my J7 to S9. I love it so far. It runs quickly and seems to be cooperating. It's lighter and thinner than the J7, so that is another plus. The picture quality is sharp and has a lot of fun features to play with (like create your own emoji!). Plus, the price is acceptable, compared to T-Mobile's site....",BestBuy

iphone,2,"I understand that switching from Android to iPhone can take some getting use to but, I wasn't aware that there would be annoying inconveniences. It was difficult establishing an ""Apple ID"" (because of it's confusing codes), which is required to download apps. The tech-support representative didn't even know how. I finally figured it out after by myself after tirelessly switching back and forth trying the different codes. The worst thing about this phone is that if you don't leave the phone unlocked it will timeout and close text messages and forms that you are filling out. I'm a slow texter, and it was a headache continuously having to retext long messages, and filling out the Apple ID application. I'm sincerely considering returning the phone and getting the Samsung s9+.",BestBuy
iphone,5,"This phone is the golden phone!! I love it! It works so good it never locks up, I have GREAT battery life. The IPhone X has a battery life of 10 hrs I think and who is going to use there phone more than 10 hours. Rather than the XS or XS Max there is more battery life for them two but I am never on my phone for 10 hours a day! The IPhone X has a A11 Chip and XS and XS max has a A12 but there is no noticeable difference between them on a daily basis your not going to recognize it. I love my iPhone X and you should get one! Also my Best Buy sales person rocks shout out to her!",BestBuy
iphone,4,"So I bought an unlocked phone by paying the full price. The phone did not have a pin to open the sim slot. And when I started it, it was receiving network which an unlocked phone shouldn't have.

Took it to the store next day and the phone is unlocked but it had a sim card in it which was taken out by the associate for me. 

The phone works fine, but I don't have a pin to change the sim in future. Will have to use a paperclip, I guess.",BestBuy
iphone,4,I love Best Buy but sometimes they have false advertising ads. I bought a new iPhone and the ad had “buy an iPhone get 3 months of Apple Music” but I never got that 3 month trial. I tried contacting bestbuy but after talking to several people they told me it was for new Apple customers but the ad didn’t say new customers. So that’s why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.,BestBuy
iphone,1,"The iPhone X is the latest and greatest when it comes to price. $900 minimum just for the phone. Then there is a $25 activation fee and a $50 case plus any additional accessories like a car charger. I walked out of the store short $1,250.00 The bells and whistles on this phone don't come close to justifying the price.",BestBuy
iphone,5,Got this phone for my son for christmas. He was happily surprised. I really love that Bestbuy offers the refurbished and gently used electronics. They are all good quality and checked out by the pros and it saves me some money. I myself am not an Apple fan but the kiddo is. And he is very happy with it.,BestBuy

galaxy,5,"I use the Galaxy S9 for my work number I currently work for Sprint, so I feel like I'm pretty in touch when it comes to all things cellular. I havent had an trouble with the S9 and I went ahead and bought it outright once I decided I'd be keeping it for a while. The camera could be a bit better (I have the Note 9 too and that camera is fantastic) but its still far better than others currently on the market. The features and customization that Galaxy offers is one of the reasons I love this line so much. I also had an S8 and S8+  and I feel like they top themselves every release. Was very happy to see the fingerprint reader was moved, along with the addition of purple as a color choice. This has been a good, reliable phone so far and I'm very pleased with it.",influenster
galaxy,5,I had a Samsung Galaxy S6 I loved it into that having to switch to an LG for a while and was just able to get a Samsung Galaxy S9 love all the new features it took me a little while to figure out how to do everything on it and not push the wrong button I was nervous about the beveled screen but it's already fail didn't break so So glad I had it in a case. I definitely recommend this to anyone who already loves the Samsung Galaxy phones and even those that haven't  Tried them yet. In has a very easy to use interface nothing to overly complicated just a ton of features Bixby is super easy to use and controls just almost everything on the phone by voice command. The only thing I don't like about it is that instead of having a Samsung music it uses play music to get to the music files on your phone which makes it a little more difficult,influenster
galaxy,5,I currently have the S10e the clarity on this phone is astonishing. I've had it for less than a week and I'm in love with it. Not a disappointing purchase at all and because I bought it through sprint I got free Hulu with it and only pay about $11 a month with a contract free plan.,influenster
galaxy,4,I adore this phone! I got the rose gold one and it so so aesthetically pleasing. The camera is also amazing and as I am a photographer and vlogger that is very important to me. The battery life is also great and the speed is excellent.,influenster
galaxy,5,This phone is amazing. I have not had a single problem with it. I love how great quality the camera has. I enjoy the quality of videos and music. I love the speakers and the battery life. The built in edge screen is everything.,influenster
galaxy,5,"I just got this phone for Valentines/ my birthday and I really like it. It is perfect for my hand. My last phone was huge galaxy edge 6 plus and it really hurt my hand trying to use it. This is more confy and ofcourse everything you love about samsung. Its glass all around so get a shock proof case and screen protector. No home button. All the cool new features. The finger print is easy index in the back. Face recognition, beautiful camera. Extra slow mow and gourgous screen. Ohhh yess way better charger really fast and HEADPHONE JACK 👏👏😂 ofcourse got it just in time for a new one to launch S10 but its ok Im loving it. Oh 2 speakers so sounds great. My last galaxy was really loud too.  Samsung Galaxy S9",influenster
galaxy,3,Battery did not hold a charge i play no games. It lags. Never dropped no scratches. Really expensive to get it checked out by Verizon. It did not meet my expectations that the s8 did. Yes it is reliable. Room for improvement is less curved edges. Samsung Galaxy S9,influenster
galaxy,4,"I actually have an s9+ but I couldn't fund it to review, but they are pretty close in pretty much everything. I upgraded to this phone from an LG stylo 4, and I honestly dont have any real complaints about the phone. I've not experienced any slowness, or problems that are notable. The only thing that really bothers me is the Bixby button. I dont use it, and it really gets on my nerves because you cannot completely disable it. So I'm always hitting the button and it as virtually useless... unless you use those things. Other than that, amazing phone. The edge feature is very nice. Screen resolution is amazing.",influenster
galaxy,5,I absolutely love my  Samsung Galaxy S9. I have my life and everything I need in the palm of my hands thanks to  Samsung.  I love their quality of products and how they continue to amaze me with the new products and technology. This phone has a near professional camera quality & has so many different options to help navigate everyday life,influenster
galaxy,5,"I've just bought my S9 plus and I LOOVE IT! I was always a Samsung / Android buyer and recently upgraded my phone. It is a bit different (in a good way). The camera IS AMAZING, we've compared it to Iphone camera and it took better pictures which was a bit shocking. I still have not had time to explore the rest of my phone but it had me with the camera!",influenster
galaxy,5,Earlier this yeah I purchased a Galaxy S9+ earlier this year. I really love this phone I bought in lilac the color and the look of this phone is so sleek and beautiful I just love it. It's pretty lightweight. The screen is bigger but the display on it is unlike any other. The dual camera on this phone is amazing I absolutely love it!!,influenster
galaxy,5,This phone is amazing! Upgrades from the Note 5. Yes I know plenty have came out but just and no use to upgrade u til the 9+ came out. Mainly wanted it because of the camera and it does not disappoint. I've took pictures and had people ask if I'm a photographer. Besides the camera part the phone is used friendly and has all the latest and greatest stuff you would want with a phone.,influenster
galaxy,5,"I have had 3 galaxy smartphones over the past 7 to 8 years.  I love each one more than the last.  However, the s9 is my favorite.  I like the edge to edge screen, the fact that its then enough to fit in my wallet and dont get me started on the camera.  Leta just say that my digital camera would get jealous of my phone camera if he had feelings.",influenster
galaxy,5,"My boyfriend has the Samsung Galaxy S9, and i have recently been messing around with it. Let me just say, i think it is amazing! Its best feature is definitely the camera. As always, Samsung phones are an investment, but i believe that they are better than iPhones for a bit cheaper price! I 100%recommend trying one out.",influenster
galaxy,4,"Still getting acquainted so not sure how to use all the features. I learn something new everyday. I truly love the camera though, wish the volume could be louder & the airphones it comes with sucks 😝 I got a great deal so overall im pleased",influenster
galaxy,5,"I am not an Apple fan and have been using LG the past few years. However, my husband got the S9, and I was intrigued with the camera features. As a social media influencer, I like having a good camera on my phone at all times. The phone is easy to use, and I love all the new features!",influenster
galaxy,5,"I am loving my new Galaxy S9 so far! The screen is bright with dynamic images and the camera is outstanding. I have been loving all the additional features on this phone. I purchased mine through Samsung since they currently have the best deal, plus I was able to get 128gb built in!",influenster
galaxy,4,"Great phone, love the color. It's very easy to navigate,  has face recognition. Great memory space for extra photos, like always samsung does it all wouldnt ever change. The camera as well is great and the sleek design.  Such a great phone my mom got one as well!",influenster
galaxy,4,This is a good quality phone my sister used to have one of these phones it's a really good phone the camera is really nice and clear and it has a nice edge and it's easy to use and light it is a bit expensive but I will still recommend this smartphone,influenster
galaxy,3,Hardly use my phone don't even know why i bought it lol but i definatly loved my iphone more 😏 not a phone person maybe thats why. I was so hesitant on the new iphone and this one...,influenster
galaxy,5,It's a beautiful phone. I got mine pink and my boyfriend blue. It's really fast. Besy feature is everything. It meets more than expectations! It's the future!. Its really reliable. Battery lasts FOREVER!! I could go 3 days without charging it. I recommend this amazing phone.,influenster
galaxy,5,I absolutely love my phone! I use the front camera to take most of my photos and they come out just great. There are so many amazing features besides the camera too!!!,influenster
galaxy,5,Got this phone with my upgrade. I had an LG V20 before and love that but this Samsung phone knocked it out of the park! I love the sleek design it has the camera quality is great!,influenster
galaxy,5,"I love my S9 bright and clear resolution, great features that keeps you on your phone to discover a lot of things. The battery life is so great !! It can last up to 18 hours maybe longer I only tested 18 hours with out charging.",influenster
galaxy,5,"Amazing cell phone, my husband gift me a  Samsung Galaxy S9 for Christmas and I think it's a regular phone but no have amazing technology and recognition I love it. I recommend everybody try you gonna love. And if you by in Samsung.com you can get a incredible offer",influenster
galaxy,3,"Honestly, I hate this phone and can't wait to switch back to an iphone. It's slow. The icons move all over if you hold the phone in your hand while it's unlocked. Photos are regularly blurry. Blergh.",influenster
galaxy,4,"I'm so used to Samsung products that this device was a breeze to use. I love the size of this phone, but wish that the Bixby button was in a different spot because I accidentally hit or all the time.",influenster
galaxy,5,My boyfriend loves his new phone. It's all he can talk about and it's making me kind of jealous. It's so fast and the picture on it is so clear. So many new features and little things here and there. I may just have to upgrade myself!,influenster
galaxy,5,"I absolutely LOOOOOVVEEE my s9+ It has an amazing camera, battery life, and the glass, so far, is unbreakable (knock on wood) 😂I would recommend this to EVERYONE!  Samsung Galaxy S9",influenster
galaxy,5,My s9 is amazing.  I havent had any issues with it at all.  If you are an android fan and Samsung fan to get this phone. Samsung Galaxy S9 bought at Tmobile,influenster
galaxy,4,"Purchased the Samsung s9+ and was not disappointed. Samsung outdid themselves, the camera is superb, the battery is amazing and they even implemented device management so that you no longer have to rely on third party applications.The device is large but fits very nicely into your hands and is very sleek so it is easy to put into and take out of your pockets.Only issue is the Bixby button, which can be accidentally pressed and ends up leaving the screen on... ultimately wasting battery. I understand they're trying to make this implementation work but I think by trying to force it, it ended up backfiring. Instead, they should have made it by double tapping the power it brings up bixby instead of creating an entirely new button, which is very inconveniently placed.",influenster
galaxy,5,"I was a Iphone lover, well as I notice that I needed to get a new phone obviously I was going upgrade to the newer version. My husband suggested to look into The Samsung, trust me when i say i didn't know how many things you can do with this phone. This phone is amazing with the camera, and awesome features it has wow, I will never go back to an iphone again. BTW yes if your a iphone person yes it may take sometime to get use to it. You will love it! :)",influenster
galaxy,5,Finally switched after years of apple use to android mostly due to needing an adaptor for wireless headphone on apple 9 and X. It was a bit harder getting used to but the biggest difference is the amazing picture quality and the battery life. No longer am I tied down to chargers. And not needing to replace chargers is amazing also. Thanks Samsung for designing a great phone. I would have gone with the S9 plus but needed a phone that would fit into my uniform pocket at work and that's a bit too large,influenster
galaxy,4,"I currently have this phone through Sprint. I really like it! I've been using iPhone for the past 5 years so I had to get used to Android again. Let me tell you, a lot has changed lol. I love this phone, but I have issues from time to time loading stuff; even on my wifi, and I had no problem at all with my iPhone. It's not detrimental and it usually functions fine. The features and usability of this phone is amazing!",influenster
galaxy,2,"While your using your phone, make sure you dont burn your hand as this phone gets hot thru using the phone, charging the phone, or even just keeping it to the side. This phone is not a food phone as I have had to get 2 other replacements as the inside gets too hot and messes with the phone (not operational)",influenster
galaxy,5,I have had several iPhones and with some troubles with mine a week ago I went to Verizon and had to get away from iPhones all together. I have had this phone for a couple days now and it's been the best phone I've ever had. The cameras better and the sound quality is amazing. I will never go back!,influenster
galaxy,4,I am using this phone from last april..n it worked good but last month it stopped charging saying moisture detected in port..n i had to take it to samsung repair center and they changed the charging port chip..thats very off because Samsung says its a waterproof device,influenster
galaxy,5,"This is the phone I switched to after having an iPhone for years. Although it has a somewhat hefty pricetag, its sturdy and i can guarantee its going to last me for a long time.",influenster
galaxy,3,This phone has alot of good up grades but the durability of the phone is horrible. If you even bump your phone you it will dent the crap out of it. And if you drop it the phone is done. Recommendations is to get case and screen protector,influenster
galaxy,5,"I have the s9+ and I love it! The camera is awesome, it has Google assistant, Bixby and facial recognition and Iris scanner. Great phone! I like it better than the iPhones",influenster
galaxy,5,I love this phone! I have always had Samsung but my husband traded in his iPhone for the S9. We love the camera. We can get great pictures of our little one without pulling out our giant camera.,influenster
galaxy,4,"I really love this phone. It has a wonderful camera, I can take a very great picture. The only problem is the battery, it is not a very long duration, I have to charge twice daily.",influenster
galaxy,5,"I have the Galaxy s9 now. I broke the screen on it 2 months ago and it is still kicking. I love the feautures on it, It's quick, easy to use and i love the camera.",influenster
galaxy,2,"The battery is not that powerful,  the quality of the screen and the pictures is terrible and i paid it so expensive i really regret getting this phone",influenster
galaxy,5,Love this phone! I previously had a Samsung Galaxy S6 and finally upgraded to this phone. I love all of the features and it has a great battery life.,influenster
galaxy,5,"My last 3 phones have been Samsung..I love them..The S9 takes great pics, the size is good..not too big or too small..I always recommend Samsung 😃",influenster
galaxy,5,Just got the phone two weeks ago . I love the camera especially the slow-motion.  I like that it has a wireless charger if you choose to buy it .,influenster
galaxy,4,I have always loved Samsung products I love my s9 the only issue I have is the camera makes everything look so wide. But I recommend this,influenster
galaxy,5,I have the galaxy s9+ and it has been the best samsumg phone I've had. I wish the camera were a but better but overall I love this phone,influenster
galaxy,3,Worked awesome for the first few months and now it's acting all weird with random pop ups and little mini freezes. Has awesome camera.,influenster
galaxy,5,I love the upgrades from the s8. The camera on the s9+ is amazing. And overall quality is great. I do hate how many updates there are,influenster
galaxy,5,Very intuitive technology I love the retina scanner and the updated features I use my phone for alot of freaking and fitness tracking,influenster
galaxy,5,I'm OBSESSED with this phone. I switched over from apple and didn't have any issues with the new software. Best part is the camera,influenster
galaxy,5,Just got it but I love it! It's so pretty. It doesn't seem like there are any interesting new features. I hate bixby but oh well,influenster
galaxy,5,"Probably best device out there in a while.  I love all the updates and the camera is out of this world,  pictures come out perfect.",influenster
galaxy,5,"I've had past samsungs but this one is amazing!!! Love the Samsung s9s curved edge, the fact it can get wet is the best plus!!",influenster
galaxy,5,"I love Samsung product due to being able to add a micro sd card, something Apple doesn't offer. Also, they're sturdy phones.",influenster
galaxy,5,I love Samsung. Their battery lasts wayyyyy longer than ape iphone. Just recently upgraded to the S9. Loving it all the way!!,influenster
galaxy,5,"I've had Samsung galaxy's for awhile, 5, 6, 7 and so on, I love my phone so much not sure if ever switch from a galaxy haha",influenster
galaxy,5,I've been a huge fan of Samsung products for years. This phone lives up to the brand and continues to impress,influenster
galaxy,3,Not too much better than the Samsung Gateway S8. The screen sometimes doesn't work. The camera still sucks.,influenster
galaxy,5,Amazing!! Has to be the best phone I've ever had.  I really like the sleek look with no button on the front.  The finger printer sensor works quickly and I find paying using contactless very easy.  My only criticism is that the battery isn't lasting as long as I would like.  After a year I can't get through a day without at least two charges.,influenster
galaxy,4,"I love this smartphone as it is the one I am currently using. It has an amazing camera, an impressive amount of memory and the infinity display is astounding. The only downside is the battery life, it can last a full day, however, this is something that can be improved. The charging time is super fast and the phone is elegant and beautiful.  Samsung Galaxy S9",influenster
galaxy,5,I am soo glad I upgraded to this phone. I've always had Samsung phones but this is by far the best. Love the sleek design and the amazing features. The battery life is unreal and the phone itself is very durable. Definitely would recommend this phone to anyone.,influenster
galaxy,5,"Always had samusungs and I love this version. I like the curved edges and updates from previous Samsung's, I've dropped it a couple of times and don't even have any scratches which I am impressed by. The camera is very high quality which is great.",influenster
galaxy,5,Este es un telefono de impacto :O es hermosoo!! su camara es fantastica y para navegar en internet es muy rapido ♥ Yo recomendaria todos los telefonos de esta marca la verdad son perfectos ♥,influenster
galaxy,4,I had  a flip phone for emergencies. Went on a family plan so my daughter got me a Samsung Galaxy and love everything about it. It's affordable with lots of space and the camera is really great.,influenster
galaxy,5,"Smoothest phone experience I've had. My job requires me to test phones, so i've used quite a few. Every other phone I've used has been quite laggy and slow, I've also often kicked out of apps for random errors. My s9 has caused me absolutely no issues, the touch screen is very responsive. The camera is incredible quality, probably the best I've used, although the slo-mo isn't as good as I thought it would be, you have to sacrifice the quality by a lot to do a slo-mo video. The sound quality is also amazing, if you have this phone and haven't enabled Dolby atmos in the settings I highly recommend you do.",influenster
galaxy,5,"I love my phone! I switched to this phone from my iPhone 7, because there's a lot more you can do with Android phones, and I was honestly really scared that I would regret it, but I don't. Not once have I had the thought that I hate this phone. It hasn't given me any problems, the camera quality is good, it has long battery life, and it also is water resistant, which I can prove is true, because two days ago my phone fell in the bathtub, and it's completely fine. I have the S9 in their exclusive purple colour. I think it's great, and definately recommend!",influenster

galaxy,5,"To say Samsung has really brought the full force of the smartphone into S9 ,it has the best camera quality that i have seen in any of the smartphones but it is a bit costly and for this price point it has lot of features !!",influenster
galaxy,5,Omg love this phone and its features! The camera quality speaks for itself. It delivers sharp amazing shots. And the manual camera is awesome too! The battery life is great the rest of the feature dont even get me started on it  just speechless. Worth the buy worth it for any andriod person or apple to android,influenster
galaxy,5,Best smartphone I have ever bought! I've always been a Sony girl but recently decided to give Samsung a go. Definitely the best decision I've made. Easy to use interface and plenty of features to make whatever you're doing a lot easier. Really good performance and have had no issues AT ALL so far!,influenster

galaxy,5,I do love my phone I do wish I got the bigger one with the better back camera though. It's still the best phone I have ever owned.,influenster
galaxy,4,"Just upgraded my phone today from the Galaxy s6 to s9 and LOVE it! With so much more space, camera is excellent! I'm obsessed!",influenster
galaxy,4,I like the phone minus how breakable the screen is.  Even with a case in it I have managed to put two major cracks in it,influenster

galaxy,5,Waaaaaaaaaaaaaw its beautiful and very veri veri nice !!! I loved so much !!!!! Amazing !! His color is very cool,influenster
galaxy,5,"I have the s9 plus which has a bigger screen, battery and dual camera. The s9 and the plus are fantastic phones. Leaving apple to samsung was the best thing I ever did. There are some features about this handset I love the most-it has 2 speakers on the front, so is much louder than  other Samsung's-it still has it's headphone/aux port and comes with fantastic headphones.- you are able to customise the look of the screen, keyboard, fonts, colours and app icons by applying themes which is a preinstalled app- the screen is fantastic, the phone is easy to use and looks beautiful It has other features like iris unlocking, ar emoji, slowmo mode etc.If you like android, or want to change manufacturer then this is a good place to start. Couldn't live without my trusty samsung",influenster
galaxy,4,I really love samsung in general .. this cell is just perfect and so easy to uses ... i  had samsung 6 abd this was  amazing very easy to use .. maybe the camera is less professional then the camera of iphone but i still in love with samsung because like i said is to easy to use .. so i really want to have this samsung 9 🎀🎀,influenster
iphone,5,"Pros: This is easily the most outstanding gadget I have ever owned. I was dreading losing the home button and having a smaller phone in my hand but my wifeâ€™s 6s Plus now seems like it was from a different era. The Face ID, 3D Touch, Swipe System and Touch to Open all work like a dream, meaning I can whizz around the phone with minimal thought and effort. The size is perfect, after loving the larger Plus series I now realise the X is better balanced for me without reverting to a smaller screen. I love being able to swipe between open apps without having to manoeuvre my thumb up and down the screen, meaning, with my poor memory, if I wanted to write down something from, say, the calculator into notes I can do so easily with a flick of my thumb. The wireless charging is outstanding, so much so, Iâ€™ve bought chargers for my bedroom and my lounge and hope I never have to go back to plugging the cable in again. The screen is absolutely stunning. Watching videos and looking at photographs is a pleasure and, in all honesty, makes me want to watch more which Iâ€™ve never bothered with before on a phone. The camera also seems much better but Iâ€™ve not had chance to experiment yet as itâ€™s something I need to learn more about. Overall, I was worried about taking a punt on the X but I know now that if Iâ€™d not upgraded (as was my plan) or gone with the 8 Plus, Iâ€™d be pretty gutted right now. Apple has managed to reignite my love of the smart phone again with the most perfect bit of kit I could have imagined. Thank you!Cons: The cost is absolutely crippling for people like me. Luckily I got a fair forces discount (20%) on the contract price which brought it into my range, though still massively top end. The only other problem I have is the reachability function. Itâ€™s something I use often but struggle to get right on the X, especially when thereâ€™s something to activate right where my thumb will be when I attempt to swipe down. I dare say, without my wireless charger next to my chair, the battery could be an issue as Iâ€™m a heavy user of the phone, so I canâ€™t say either way with certainty at the moment.",influenster
iphone,4,"This was a very nice upgrade from my iPhone 7. I do miss the home button at times but itâ€™s been a week and Iâ€™ve gotten used this phone. I love how it scans your face to unlock your phone, thatâ€™s actually pretty dope! The camera quality is so much better than my old phone which is nice since Iâ€™m big on photography. I gave it a 4 starts because for some odd reason the camera in my Snapchat is extremely zoomed in and I canâ€™t fix it. I read online they are working on an upgrade for Snapchat so that itâ€™s not so zoomed in. Other than that I love this phone. #newphonewhodis",influenster
iphone,5,"This is technically for the iPhone XR, since I canâ€™t seem to create a review for that specific product. I LOVE the iPhone XR. Itâ€™s a great compromise between quality and value (I did not want a phone that retailed for 1k+). Performance is fantastic. Excellent battery life. Every once in a great while, the touch screen is slightly non-responsive, but it corrects itself pretty quickly when that happens. The camera is excellent, though not as amazing as everyone makes it out to be. Definitely recommend this phone.",influenster
iphone,5,"I was skeptical about getting this new phone. I love Apple. I love the iPhone. I just didnâ€™t know about upgrading to a new version of it.ðŸ˜‚ I am stuck in my ways. But, I love this phone. It took a bit to get used to. Not having the home button and the new way of screenshooting. Itâ€™s actually a good change. It was worth it. Not bigger that the iPhone 6 really. Just there is more screen room so it seems way bigger. I am happy I took the step. I would recommend it.",influenster
iphone,5,I have the iPhone XS Max and I absolutely love it. Itâ€™s expensive very but I think itâ€™s worth the price esp for the camera and I take a lot of photos. This phone absolutely meets every expectation I expected of it. I would recommend an apple phone to anyone or any apple device I have never had any problems with apple and I have had every apple phone since the 3GS. Love love love apple!,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iphone X, its sleek, stylish, great display(OLED), always fast. I recommend this over the Xs since its only $900 if you can still find them at non apple retailers since Apple officially discontinued this model due to the fact that they want to sell the Xs'.",influenster
iphone,5,"I absolutely love this phone. I love that it takes love pictures so if someone or something suddenly moves, you can go back in the moment of taking the picture to chose where the person or thing was in the picture. I have dropped my phone in the toilet (I know yuck) while doing my makeup and got it out and have had absolutely no problems with it.",influenster
iphone,5,"Its great I love it its so different,special and stunning its really cool,especially the face locksrceen even though its little expensive it deserves every buck i put in it totally recommended and one of the best features is the 3d talking people really cool really special I would totally recommend it to others",influenster
iphone,4,"I like my phone, it is fast and I like the screen on it. However, I think that it is too expensive for what it does. I honestly just really like the face recognition because you don't need to keep typing in your password but overall I think that's what I paid for. The camera could be better and so can the resolution.",influenster
iphone,5,I love my iPhone X. Granted it is not much different than the 9 but it does have a few perks to it. I like the sleep look of the phone and I love IOS!! Itâ€™s easy to use and the sleek design is very appealing. I have been using the iPhone since the very first one. Iâ€™m a dedicated iPhone fan!!,influenster
iphone,4,"I love a phone that fits in my small hands and I never upgrade to just get the new best thing. So this was a first...I upgraded just to upgrade. I am not disappointed. The facial recognition is intuitive and fast, camera is upgraded with amazing portrait options and 4K video is a reality. I am just getting into the features but if you are charging me 1200 for a phone, when I could buy a new laptop, it had better live up to expectations and then go beyond. So far my fav feature is the enlarged screen and intuitive lighting. Believe it or not, I can now browse my phone as it dims itself when putting the baby to bed without him getting distracted. Mom win!",influenster
iphone,5,So I have had my iPhone X for about a year now and I love it. Don’t get me wrong it has its flaws. Like when I broke my phone a few months back and It kept calling 911 because when it broke it messed something up with the side button. I kinda feel like the power button being able to do that is a no go.,influenster
iphone,5,"When this came out, my husband and I got this on the sale deal. I upgraded from a iPhone 7 to this. I love this phone. It has an amazing camera. I love the way it fits into my hands. I definitely recommend purchasing this phone if you’re an iPhone lover.",influenster
iphone,5,"I was a Samsung Galaxy Android user, my daughter on the other hand loved 📱 I tried it at one time and just hated it, after using the android and not having that home button it made it easier for me to swipe and get where I needed to be. Now this IPHONE X has completely won me over💯🔥🍎 by far the iPhone X is the best phone I’ve ever used!! There is still so much I have to learn but the camera is simply amazing and A11 Bionic chip just put this phone in a league of its own. For those of you that are use to the home button it’s my understanding that the IPhone 8 and 8plus has the A11 Bionic chip along with the home button your use to!! I highly recommend this phone to either user the X is now very adaptable for the android user!",influenster
iphone,5,I absolutely love this phone!! From all the features to the color of my phone. The price is high but worth every penny. It’s very reliable I’ve yet to have a dropped call. And this phone doesn’t damage easily. I highly recommend this phone to users!!,influenster
iphone,5,"Upon first receiving I figured ... wow what another waste of money! However, the phone has since grown on me. I love the headphone update and the glass design. You will need to be careful and have a durable case because if you drop it, it’s going to crack on either side. The no home button addition was quite annoying at first, but I gave since become more acquainted with it. Once you learn all the tricks and get used to the gestures and motions, this phone is so much more awesome and so high tech. One thing that surely annoys me is the Face ID. It does not always work well, especially when laying down.  My favorite feature is the Animoji and the Portrait Mode. You can basically have a legit photoshoot with your phone.",influenster
iphone,4,"I have had the X since last November and so far have been pretty pleased with it. I love that they redesigned the exterior without a home button or that extraneous space above and below the screen. Also, love the face recognition feature (although there are times that it does not work that well). The swiping feature is super cool and so much easier and more streamlined than before. I really didn't notice a big change in the camera capability, the picture look good but not that much different from the previous I phone. Last weekend my screen suddenly stopped working for no reason. Apple was great though and replaced it at no cost as it was under warranty. Great model, would recommend!",influenster
iphone,5,I’d love to get the IPhone X for the holidays! I have always been Team I phone for the longest time. I have the iPhone 6S and of course would like to upgrade to the iPhone X. I’ve heard nothing but great stuff about the new phone. My best friend has it and raves about it all the time. It’ll definitely be a step up from the iPhone I currently have! Fingers crossed I get it these coming up holidays!! Hehe :)Apple iPhone X,influenster
iphone,4,I went from an IPhone 6s Plus to this phone. My iPhone 6s battery stopped keeping its charge. I really love the size of this phone and the fact that I still have a nice size screen. The phone is slim to fit in your pocket but you don’t feel like you are struggling to push the buttons on the keyboard. I do not miss the fact that there is no home screen button. I had to get use to using the lock button and the up volume button for screen shots. The only thing I’m not impressed with is that at night the facial recognition has a hard time and you have to punch in your code in order to unlock your phone. Overall I’m very happy with this phone.,influenster
iphone,4,I really like my iPhone X. I got it right when it came out and it had some glitches especially in the cold but as more updates come out the better it is working. My favorite feature it the portrait mode. It really makes all my pictures look nice. Some apps are sticky to use since some buttons are in the cut out of where the camera is out. But with more updates the better the phone is getting. The picture I have below I did not edit just used one of the portrait mode options to take. Apple iPhone X,influenster

iphone,5,"I’ve had the opportunity to use the X & it is by far one of the best devices on the market.  The price tag is a bit much, just like all apple devices but it’s features are outstanding. I recommend this device to anyone.",influenster
iphone,5,This is a great product. The iPhone X has a great display and is known for it’s full screen and Face ID. The problem is that there is a notch that bothers everyone. But honestly I don’t have a problem. It’s price is $1000-1500. Which is a little expensive. The iOS 11 has been a problem for the iPhone X but with iOS 12 coming out there should be a lot a bug fixes. But other than that great phone. And great for games and Animoji.,influenster
iphone,5,im so happy i upgraded from my iphone 6 to the iphone x the design is so sleek and looks amazing the camera quality is breathtaking and the size is perfect i don’t think a phone can get better than this,influenster
iphone,5,"The X is simply breathtaking. It is a break from the iPhones that we have become used to, with new gestures, features, etc. The X is FAST and the touch screen is silky smooth. On paper the 8 and X do not look that different but touch and feel wise there is a difference. The camera on the X is simply amazing with built-in optical image stabilization on both camera/focal lengths. The detail is crisp and sharp. This truly rivals a DLSR camera. Music play on the X is better also, maybe its the sexiness of the phone but it is louder.",influenster
iphone,5,"This phone is really great. I took the leap and upgraded from an LG G Stylo 5.7"" Android Smartphone - Boost Mobile and this phone is SO much better. I love the camera and the portrait mode. I’m into photography so the camera is amazing. I also love how durable the phone is. I’m very clumsy and it’s been very reliable. Yes, the price is expensive but it is worth it. Here’s a photo I took on the iPhone X.",influenster
iphone,5,I love my new phone! The battery is much better than other phones. I love the colors and size of the phones. They are a little pricey but most phones are. Definitely met my expectations.,influenster
iphone,5,"I used to be an android user and then a few years ago I switched to Apple and never looked back. This has been my favorite phone ever. The portrait mode makes it super fun to take pictures of my little boys (and, lets be honest, cats). I listen to hours of podcasts every week and the sound clarity is perfect. This phone is FAST. The facial recognition has made my life immensely more easy. I recommend this to everyone. If you’re considering it- just take the plunge. It’s worth it! OH! Get a really good phone protector.",influenster
iphone,4,"Ah... the iPhone X. One of the most popular phones currently out on the market. I definitely wouldn’t say it would fall under the affordable column, it’s really expensive! (Almost so expensive that it’s not worth getting). However, the display of the phone is gorgeous- so glad Apple finally got rid of those huge bezels, they finally released a phone that looks similar to its current competitors. The camera quality is insane on this phone- don’t  even get me started on portrait mode, it’s amazing!",influenster
iphone,5,"This iPhone is the perfect size! Slim with a larger screen than the 6,7, or 8. The phone can be found at any Apple Store or on apple's online website. It has an amazing camera including the selfie mode. We heavily rely on our phones and they make our lives so much easier by reminding us of what needs to be done, setting our alarms for us, & allowing us to put important events on our calendars. It also saves and captures our beautiful memories. This phone provides more security features such as face recognition which is much needed. I would love this for Christmas! This is my #GiftCrush #Influenster #WishesCanComeTrue #OnTheNiceList Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,Ok here is the skinny!!! Love the phone. I leaped from the 7+ to the iPhone X. I do miss the larger size. The X size is in-between the 8 and 8+ size. the phone is also narrower than the plus sizes. But the new design is gorgeous and sleek and will be costly in repairs if dropped. It will take some getting used to because the home screen is no longer there but change is good and i am sure every purchaser will get use to it but if  you can't live without the home button there is  the option for  8 and 8+ which is similar except for face ID and the changes to the front camera for selfy and the anemoji which are fun. the notch at the top as some what bother some at first but now i don't care about it. The X is fast and i am sure overtime with software update will get even more advanced and better.,influenster
iphone,5,I want this phone I would love to upgrade from 8 plus but sadly itâ€™s a little to high for me to get but who knows someday lords will I might get to try one or have one,influenster
iphone,5,"So worth the money! I recently started a blog and needed and new phone and camera. We just went with the iphone X and it takes amazing photos! It's  super fast and the user interface is only slightly different from the others. You'll get used to it in no time. I really love the face ID feature too. I was very skeptical about it, but now I love using it to log into my bank account and make purchases. I feel more secure.",influenster
iphone,2,I donâ€™t understand what all the hype is about. Youâ€™re paying 1000 dollars just to get some emojis that imitate you and Face ID which honestly sucks because half the time it canâ€™t even recognize you and you canâ€™t even switch it to Touch ID because they removed that option. I guess Apple is all about one or the other. Also it doesnâ€™t have a headphone jack which I hate. Whatâ€™s the purpose of removing a headphone jack? I find it to be a stupid decision.,influenster
iphone,5,Was very hesitant with my purchase of this. I wasnâ€™t taking to the idea of it but when I got it in my hands I couldnâ€™t put it down. Truly a beautiful piece of tech,influenster
iphone,5,"I have always been a huge fan of Apple products and iPhones, but I had held onto my iPhone 5s for about 5 years and never really felt the desire to upgrade until the iPhone X was released.  I ordered it the very first day it came available and I am so glad I did!  I absolutely love it!!!  The face recognition is so convenient and works perfectly.  I love the upgraded camera features it has and the better battery life.  The change I like most is how they got rid of the home button on the front of the phone.  With my iPhone 4s, I had issues after a while and my home button didn't always work.  Since this doesn't have a button, that's one thing I don't have to worry about breaking!  Overall this is an amazing phone!  I would highly recommend this product!",influenster
iphone,5,"I bought this phone for the camera, and display screen. This phone does not disappoint. I love the new Animoji s that come with this phone. I appreciate that the phone unlocks with my face, but sometimes find frustrating when I canâ€™t put my phone in front of my face. Overall this is a great phone with awesome new features to play with. If your a techie then this phone is for you!",influenster
iphone,5,"Iâ€™ve been an Apple user since the original iPhone, and I do seem to enjoy my iPhone X the most. The camera quality is great, the size of the screen is pleasant, and the phone itself is not too big. It is fairly expensive as most apple products are, but in my opinion worth it. It does take some serious getting used to without the center home button, but after a few weeks, you get used to it.",influenster
iphone,3,"this is actually a great product  like the facial rec feature but i personally think apple is starting to outdo themselves there is no way i would send more than the 1,000 dollars that was paid for the x alone its literally unrealistic",influenster
iphone,4,"The iPhone X is a great phone, albeit overpriced! The camera is incredible -- such a clear photo with vibrant hues and saturation. What I found amazing was that the front camera also offers high definition photos (which, on my past phone, was not the case in the slightest!) I have found the retina/eye scanner to be incredibly helpful. I never have to type in passwords anymore (such a time saver) because my retina essentially serves as my password. My biggest concern is obviously the price. It is a $1,000 smartphone, which is a tough pill to swallow. Overall it's a great, user friendly phone. The lack of a home button was something I had to get used to, but it became second nature in a matter of a few days.",influenster
iphone,5,"My bf surprised me with an early Christmas present, and letâ€™s just say Iâ€™m in love. The screen is basically the same size as any of the iPhone pluses so thatâ€™s a plus hehe. The camera is amazing I love using the portrait mode. The phone is fast and hasnâ€™t given me any problems. I just miss having a spot for a normal aux cord. It is an expensive phone though.",influenster
iphone,4,"It took me longer to live my IPhone X because it has NO button. I actually disliked it so much in the beginning that I considered returning it. After weeks of learning to work without a button, I actually got used to it and donâ€™t know how I lived without facial recognition. When unlocking the phone it actually takes longer to hold my phone up and swipe up versus just my fingerprint. There is a huge upside to facial recognition and itâ€™s passwords!! I donâ€™t need to type them because my face opens any app or site Iâ€™ve logged into. I also love the size of the phone for handling and keeping in my pocket. Quality is amazing for taking pictures and viewing/taking videos. Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,This is my #GiftCrush. As a person who needs to take great photos and be able share it through all social media. I really want this product. I feel like it would bring my music blog and social media pages so much more recognition. Plus if I go to networking events with an iPhone X it would seem like Iâ€™m on top of my game.,influenster
iphone,5,"The iPhone X was my first upgrade in years. I preordered it so it arrived the day they were released, and man, was I happy when it arrived! This phone is unlike any other iPhone. I think itâ€™s the perfect size, the colors on the screen are beautiful, and the camera is awesome! I know a lot of people complain about the notch but itâ€™s honestly never bothered me. I really love this phone and Iâ€™m so glad I got it!",influenster
iphone,5,The new Iphone X is amazing!  The screen is bigger since they took the button away.  The graphics on the camera are stellar.  The emoji app where you can record your voice to match the movements of an emoji is beyond amazing.  And last but not least.... the face recognition is unbelievable.,influenster
iphone,5,"Apple is so so much better then Samsung. Iâ€™ve had Apple products all my life. I love the IPhone X, itâ€™s a bit harder to use then the traditional iPhones but you do get use to it afterwards. It is a little bit pricy for a phone but your paying for high quality!",influenster
iphone,5,"Apple iPhone X S MaxI absolutely love this phone, I purchased mine straight from at&t, it has an amazing camera and speaker system on it, it's easy to use,light weight and very entertaining, I can stay on it for hour's, it's also water proof, I can't wait to see what they come up with next, I'm blown away by the performance of this phone alone, although a little expensive it's worth every penny of it.",influenster
iphone,5,I have had a lot of iPhones and most of the time Iâ€™ll get one and upgrade as soon as a new one is available but with the iPhone X I honestly donâ€™t need anything else!! I was worried about not having the home button because I used the Touch ID for a ton of my apps but I figured I would give it a try and I love it!! I also went from an iPhone plus to the smaller x and I couldnâ€™t imagine needing anything else!! It is the perfect size with a large enough screen for watching youtube and the Face ID works amazingly in low light conditions too 10 out of 10 would recommend,influenster
iphone,2,"I hate this phone. I have since the day I got it. Phone will only answer on speaker phone. Will not connect to Bluetooth in my Jeep without doing it manually. Apple has been awful to deal with. When I first started having problems I had it less than 2 months, they wanted me to accept a refurbished phone after paying full price for a new one. Customer service was horrible and hung up on me after telling me that I needed to get an Android. Filed a complaint and still to this day, no return call or resolution. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.",influenster
iphone,5,I love my iPhone X! I was extremely nervous to switch from a home button to having no home button but I got used to it extremely quick. Iâ€™m excited to upgrade to the iPhone Max for the bigger screen but if you donâ€™t mind the screen size then I wouldnâ€™t say no to an iPhone X! #TeamiPhone ðŸ“±,influenster
iphone,5,"The first thing is that i was 90% scared that the new phone wasn’t gonna be what I expected but all my electronic devices are Apple so i decided to take the risk and buy it to my mom and I really love it❤️ I actually use it more often than her jajaja but I really recommend it 😍 if your an apple lover you’ll absolutely love it and if your not trust me, you’ll also love it because of it’s upgrades and more💕 Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,4,"IPhone or Android? Well having experience with both products, I personally prefer iPhone. I like how easy it is to use and the connectivity between other devices is something I make use of. My MacBook, iMac, and iPhone now all connect together which makes everything more convenient. The iPhone X is very very pricy. I do think that it is more expensive than it is worth. The face recognition can be annoying sometimes but it is much better than I expected. It works in the dark which is nice. The camera quality is very clear.",influenster
iphone,5,i would rate it as a 1000 it is big phone and i like it l like to have it one day and i need a ipone i have nevre had a ipone be for nd i like to have on it has grat ge bits it is the bes i give it a 4000 on all of your stuff and i love the culler i love it sooo muah..,influenster
iphone,5,I phone X is one of the best. I have multiple apps and it all open with Face ID. Super easy to use. Just glare at the apps and open. How awesome it that. I can’t live without it. I am definitely recommend this to all Influenster who have a lot of apps.,influenster
iphone,5,"I recently switched from the iPhone 6s plus to the iPhone X and I'm in love.Major changes are the camera. 1000 times better and with self portrait mode!Second there is no home screen but it took me a day to get used to.Also the alarm, calculator etc is in the top left and pull down instead of scroll up.Lastly, my thumb print never worked on my previous phones and I never liked using a 100000 passcode to unlock my phone so the face recognition analyzer is the best.",influenster
iphone,5,I love love love my IPhone X! For years I hated anything apple. I wouldn’t use anything apple especially iPhones. It was too simple and not customizable enough for me. When this phone came out I waited weeks for one to be in stock and I absolutely wouldn’t trade it for by other phone! It doesn’t feel like an iPhone with all the apple perks!! One of the best tech purchases I’ve ever made!,influenster
iphone,5,"I would like get this iPhone and test it for my youtube Subcierses and thx for your help ,I was dreading losing the home button and having a smaller phone in my hand but my wife’s 6s Plus now seems like it was from a different era. The Face ID, 3D Touch, Swipe System and Touch to Open all work like a dream, meaning I can whizz around the phone with minimal thought and effort. The size is perfect, after loving the larger Plus series I now realise the X is better balanced for me without reverting to a smaller screen. I love being able to swipe between open apps without having to manoeuvre my thumb up and down the screen, meaning, with my poor memory, if I wanted to write down something from, say, the calculator into notes I can do so easily with a flick of my thumb. The wireless charging is outstanding, so much so, I’ve bought chargers for my bedroom and my lounge and hope I never have to go back to plugging the cable in again. The screen is absolutely stunning. Watching videos and looking at photographs is a pleasure and, in all honesty, makes me want to watch more which I’ve never bothered with before on a phone. The camera also seems much better but I’ve not had chance to experiment yet as it’s something I need to learn more about. Overall, I was worried about taking a punt on the X but I know now that if I’d not upgraded (as was my plan) or gone with the 8 Plus, I’d be pretty gutted right now. Apple has managed to reignite my love of the smart phone again with the most perfect bit of kit I could have imagined. Thank you!Cons: The cost is absolutely crippling for people like me. Luckily I got a fair forces discount (20%) on the contract price which brought it into my range, though still massively top end. The only other problem I have is the reachability function. It’s something I use often but struggle to get right on the X, especially when there’s something to activate right where my thumb will be when I attempt to swipe down. I dare say, without my wireless charger next to my chair, the battery could be an issue as I’m a heavy user of the phone, so I can’t say either way with certainty at the moment.            Like This?      1",influenster
iphone,5,Received this for my birthday! My birthday is Christmas Eve. This was on my wish list this year and I needed to upgrade my phone. I love being able to send the Animoji! It’s extremely simple and easy to use. I like the changes they made to adapt for a bigger screen.,influenster
iphone,5,"My first every preference in mobile phone! ❤️🤩🥳I used all the versions of Apple mobiles and loved every series! Iphone X was the best release in apple products last year. Display, it’s features, every single feature was new. Camera is the greatest advantage and it alao has portrait mode in it. Price is little bit costly but worth buying! I definitely recommend buying Iphone X who are interested!",influenster
iphone,5,"Great phone! The camera is just something else. Had the Samsung 9 before and although they have similar screen and resolution the camera is better. At least for me. I always recommend it to others, including my husband. Lol",influenster
iphone,5,I have the iPhone XR and I love it. Wasn’t sure about not having a button at first but the Face ID is so fast and convenient! The picture quality on the front cam and back cam is amazing! Portrait mode on the front cam is my new favorite addition! Also for the XR you get to order it in colors which is really nice! The phone is so fast compared to their other phones. I like swiftness of swiping to control everything. Love it!,influenster
iphone,5,I currently made the switch from a Samsung Galaxy S5 to an iPhone X and I couldn’t be happier. I know it is a drastic change but this phone is like a smart computer in your hand. Amazing picture and video quality. Fast processing and I love that it will only unlock with my face. Very easy to get use to not having a home button and maneuvering the different functions. Very user friendly and I highly recommend it!,influenster
iphone,5,"Hands down the best iPhone yet! Great phone, great operating system, great camera, and great overall look. Absolutely love this phone and it’s definitely worth the high price, Apple continues to knock any competitors out.",influenster
iphone,5,Somebody please tell me this is real because do this causes like so much money into stores but I really think the iPhone x has a good technique and like everything is so good about it the camera oh I phones are good but I think the iPhone x is the best I never had an iPhone x so i know it is real,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone X! The cameras are amazing and I couldn’t be happier. I also do not miss the home button at all, I actually feel like the gestures are a lot more natural now. I really like the size and love the full face screen. I was hesitant in purchasing because of how expensive it is, but I’m so glad that I bought it because I am loving it and haven’t found one thing about it that I don’t like.",influenster
iphone,5,"I have this phone. It was an upgrade from my iPhone 7plus.  I like the feature of Face ID recognition when I unlock my phone.  As this is only able to be done by me.  However, if face not recognized then you can enter password.  The photos are nice and crisp.  The only problem is sometimes my callers can’t hear me and service is bad.  May not be the phone and maybe it is my sprint service that is bad.",influenster
iphone,2,I got my iPhone X in November I upgraded from iPhone 7plus and I hate it! It wa a big mistake literally the only thing I like about it is the front portrait mode and it is so expensive its ridiculous! I would recommend getting ting this phone wait for something new or get the 8n,influenster
iphone,5,"Verizon for Christmas, #paymentplan, merry Christmas to me 😁😁 love the new phone the facial recognition is amazing. Used to be a Droid fan, my teenager swapped me over to iPhones. I’m glad I switched. 👍🏻👍🏻😜",influenster
iphone,4,I bought this to take better photos but I do not see any improvement in my photos. It sometimes freezes up and won’t let me press any buttons (not locked just frozen) I honestly think iPhone just robs us all constantly making us buy new phones and cords to their accord. I appreciate that this one did not crack in the first week so I will say this is more durable than the previous models.,influenster
iphone,5,I love love love my iPhone! I’ve had one since the iPhone 4 and I will never go back to an android device. The iPhone is so easy to use. And with the X you don’t miss the home button after you get used to the gestures.,influenster
iphone,4,"I think this phone is a little overpriced, we bought this for my husband and i really tho there would be a huge difference between my iphone 7 and the X but not, the camera is slightly better and i find most of the new mechanism annoying, i know it just seems to make things easier but im not sure it does.",influenster
iphone,5,"I love the iPhone X. What can I say I have had every iPhone since they came out. I love that there is no home button and that the size of the X is more like the original iPhone. I highly recommend the iphoneX, it is much more expensive then every phone on the market. But in my opinion it is worth it.",influenster
iphone,4,I’m only giving it four stars because I miss the finger scannerThe finger scanner is a lot faster than the phone not recognizing my face at night and having to enter in a six digit code :/Besides that the phone is amazing and has the best camera everEveryone thinks I use a professional camera!,influenster
iphone,4,"I love having a big screen and all of the face recognition features are really nice, but I’m still not over only having the lighting port and not having my headphone jack. It makes it so difficult to charge with headphones because then you either need a dongle or Bluetooth, but overall it’s a nice phone. Although, I do also think that it cracks easier than my iphone6s did.",influenster
iphone,5,"It is a spectacular phone. I am obsesses with the facial recognition opposed to using your thumb. Also, the camera quality is superb. You notice everything and it is very clear. I also like the fact that the screen is bigger too.",influenster
iphone,5,"Besides the different camerra and portrait feature in photo, this new iphone is basically the same the the 8th. But it’s durable and water resistant. I’ve been using it in sauna and steam room but it’s still working fine for over a year.",influenster
iphone,5,I love my iPhone X. The notch doesn’t bother me at all and no... no one mistakes it for a Samsung. The quality of the photos are great and the pixels that are used in the screen make it look great. It’s very pricey but if you can afford it then why not?,influenster
iphone,5,"There are probably a ton of specs on this phone that I haven’t even found but still I enjoy having it. I’d say the price is high for sure, but, I feel all phones are pricey these days. Simple to use and fun to have. I would improve on the face/finger print recognition as I have issues with mine a lot. Overall I do recommend it!  Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,"I got this at a discounted price so maybe that's why I believe it was worth every penny. Seriously a huge update from what I was using before. The face recognition feature is amazing and at first I thought I wouldn't be used to not having a home button but after a few uses, I honestly prefer the new swiping to home method. I'm so impressed with this!",influenster
iphone,4,"For the most part, I love my phone. It was a bit of an adjustment from the 6S but it was mainly just little things like layout and such. I love how seamlessly things work. For instance my Bluetooth items connect much easier, however things like turning off connection to WiFi is a pain because it’s automatic. But definitely, overall, it’s a reliable phone!",influenster
iphone,5,"Loveee my new iPhone! I like that it’s normal size, the picture features are amazing!! Who needs a photographer when you have a phone like this! It’s easy to adjust to the new features, only took about a hour to get them all down! The sound is spectacular! However I will say if you’re not interested in the new features it’s pretty similar to the iPhone 6/7",influenster
iphone,4,"This phone is good I’ll give Apple that, but I just really don’t think that it is worth spending $1000 on. I mean yeah it has facial recognition but it also doesn’t have a place to plug in headphones other than where you put the charger, which to me is just a huge pet peeve.",influenster
iphone,5,"Loving my new iPhone! I’ve had it for about 4 months so I waited a while before reviewing. It is comfortable to use, easy to transition from an older iPhone to this one. Being without a home button takes some getting used to, but not too difficult. I really like the facial recognition for when you’re in a hurry and don’t want to remember passcodes.",influenster
iphone,5,"#GiftCrush #contest @InfluensterI am soooo hoping that Santa plans on leaving me the iPhone X phone under the tree for Christmas this year! 🤞🏻🙏🏻Several of my friends have it already, so I have seen it in person and it is amazing!  The picture quality is so crystal and clean, I had no idea how much better it would be then my 6 plus - but wow!! ✨",influenster
iphone,5,"I have he just about every type of phone there is and my iPhone X definitely tops the list for best phone I’ve ever had. Not having a home button takes some getting used to, but once you get it down it’s so efficient. I absolutely love the portrait mode camera setting feature as well. I no longer need to carry my DSLR around with me everywhere.",influenster
iphone,5,"Im currently using IPhone XR. Im loving it so far. Its comparatively cheaper in price thn IPhone X XS and Xmax. It has few different colors, i have the white. It has so many cool features. The camera quality is really awesome. I would definitely recommend",influenster
iphone,4,"Definitely an amazing phone. Camera and picture quality is absolutely stunning—portrait mode is amazing. However, considering it is Apple’s first phone like this, there’s some room for improvement. Definitely need to make Face ID faster and more reliable. If you don’t want to see fingerprints, I highly suggest getting the Silver version.",influenster
iphone,5,"This is a great product overall! The camera, the quality of the display and the smoothness of the software. Video editing and mobile gaming is very very crisp in this device. The camera is my favorite and would completely recommend this Apple smartphone to anyone!",influenster
iphone,5,"I love this phone! The camera quality is great and the new screen quality really takes the graphics on this phone to another level! Well done Apple- it’s still super reliable a year later (even though I wish the battery life were a tad better, but it’s not bad)",influenster
iphone,5,I just recently got this phone as a gift from my boyfriend. I have had a iPhone before but this one is a little bit different then the one I had previously I like the phone for the most part but some of the features are hard to maneuver but it might just take time to get the hang of the changes. But overall I really like the phone.,influenster

iphone,5,"It's a great phone it's definitely an upgrade from my android but it does have some things I don't like. Like how it's literally made only from glass and how one drop and it's no good. I also don't like the facial recognition because someone can just point my phone to my face and they can get into it, but besides that it's alright.",influenster
iphone,5,i’ve been an apple and  i recently upgraded to x .. at first i wasn’t sureBec i like the big phone and this is smaller than the plus but full screen. I gave it a try and i loved it..,influenster
iphone,5,"I simply cannot live without my IPhone X! One of my favorite apps that is exclusive to IPhone is Hipstamatic, a photo app. Lots of photo storage with the option to expand storage if you pay a lil extra a month... totally worth it for someone like me who takes a lot of photos. Runs smooth, love the constant app updates.",influenster
iphone,4,They don’t have the review for the xr so this is mine for it. I like the screen but I don’t like how it cuts into the camera at the top and looks like ears. Pretty much my only complain other than the fact there’s no headphone jack. The camera quality is good.,influenster
iphone,5,great product because i very like it . i see many people use iphone x they said iphone x is very good you can many things on iphone x. so i  very  want a iphone x .,influenster

iphone,5,love this phone that every time Apple comes out with a new version I always end up getting it.  I had family members always telling me Android phones were better but I always disagree.  Always tell em to buy apple products because I never have virus issues neither do they every slow down on me.,influenster
iphone,5,Omggg I got this birthday and omg it was the best decision I ever made at first I thought I wouldn’t like it because of the glass back but now that I have I love how the phone is so smooth and has no glitches the battery also last me all day long without haveing to charge till I’m ready for bed MUST BUY!!!,influenster
iphone,5,"#giftcrush I would love to have an iPhone. I need a new phone and have only ever had Androids with the exception of my iPods in the past. I would love to get an iPhone this Christmas (doesn't have to be a x, just picked one for the picture).",influenster
iphone,5,"A lot of my friends were hesitant to make the switch to iPhone X when it came out due to the absence of a home button.

iphone,5,"I love the iPhone X. Albeit was expensive, I hadn’t upgraded my phone in 4 years so it was needed. It was a great change from the iPhone 6s Plus. Easy to use with lots of extras. I do wish iPhones were more customizable.",influenster
iphone,4,"I’ve had my iPhone X for a few weeks now and I have to say I love the upgrades, but miss my Apple iPhone 7 Plus . I think the best feature of the phone is the camera! It’s amazing and the parts I ‘m still getting used to would be the loss of the home button and the size.",influenster

It has withstood my 5 yr old, as well as getting wet and being dropped repeatedly! This was a great investment so far!",influenster
iphone,5,Do I have to say this is the best phone ever? I think some people are Apple fans and some people aren’t but I love how easy this phone is to use and how the images come out. The screen is beautiful and is pretty hard to crack. I drop mine a lot and it’s never gotten a scratch.,influenster

iphone,4,"The iPhone X delivers a great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous 5.8-inch OLED screen. The rear-facing telephoto camera outshoots the iPhone 8 Plus in low light, and the front-facing camera snaps impressive portrait mode selfies. Face ID generally works fine.",influenster
iphone,5,"OW.. this iOS the best phone I ever had. In my opinion this phone worth the high price. its a compact phone, and don't think about no home button was something bad..you just need to get used to.  the pictures in this phone are amazing, with many filters to choose",influenster
iphone,5,"A amazing phone! I love it. The picture quality is amazing and the phone is just so easy to use. No home button is great, and you get more screen size. The only thing is the price but then again its apple. All their phones are pricey but this one was totally worth it.",influenster
iphone,5,"I got the iPhone X when it first came out in the silver option. From the very beginning, the screen went beyond my expectations. The design was sleek and nice, but it felt like an expensive device - and for the price that I paid for it, it definitely lived up to it.",influenster
iphone,5,"I'm loving my iPhone X so far. I just got it in yesterday and so far it's amazing. Great screen, colors look so vibrant. The speed is great, camera takes great pictures and video and the feel of the phone is really nice. It feels very fancy and sleek, which I love.",influenster

iphone,4,I recently go this in black and It’s great! It’s different from the other iPhones so it takes some getting used to. I love how it’s all screen on the front so you’re not wasting space on border. It is a little bit heavier than the other iPhones but it’s not bad.,influenster

iphone,3,"Well, I’ve always been a huge iPhone/Apple user and always had pride being a supporter of Apple products. Both me and my husband preordered these phones, stayed up until 5AM that night on the phone with T-Mobile. When receiving this phone I fell in love with the look of it (Got Silver White version). It took me 2 months to realize that I hate it, I use my phone a lot, and the actual user experience for me was disappointing. Because of the new Screenshot method, I now have 500 random screenshots of my lockscreen simply because of the way I pick my phone up off the table. I CAN TELL YOU AS A MAJOR APPLE USER, I have never had an iPhone to freeze like a windows 98 computer, but this phone does and I have to reset it every time. It’s sad to see this company change its products, Steve Jobbs would be disappointed.  iPhone had a trade mark of being behind in how advanced the specs were but what made this company wasn’t about advanced the products were, but simply how they perfected and simplified something so wonderful. Not anymore I guess.",influenster
iphone,5,"Looooooovvveeee my phone! The screen swiping quality is smooth and effortless. I love that Apple Pay is a thing in most places I shop. It’s a bit too expensive, but I got mine for $160 because of a phone update contract I had with Sprint. The camera quality is immaculate.",influenster
iphone,4,"This is a very incredible phone. The camera quality is unreal , it takes such a clear and crisps photo. The storage is very large capacity. The features are like every other iphone just bigger and better. Very pricey but it's worth it. Great phone!",influenster

iphone,5,"I love my iPhone X and am very happy with the purchase. While it was quite expensive, it was a much needed upgrade from my iPhone 6s. So much faster and better capable. The full screen image with no buttons is definitely my favorite feature.",influenster
iphone,5,I love this phone! I wanna get the max for a bigger size but this phone is great! Besides the price it is pretty good. One down side is the back can crack easily if you donâ€™t have a proper case. But it has a great screen and battery time !,influenster
iphone,3,"This phone is not worth the hype or the money. I upgrade from an my iphone to the 10 because i was egilable for an upgrade and i wanted the newst iphone. I hate that it doesnt have a headphone jack. I also get made when i want to charge my phone while listening to music. Face ID, HATE IT. They give you the opinion not to use it but touch ID isnt available because the phone doesnt have a home button. Its just like every other iphone expect they added stupid and useless features. Who cares about talking emojis, face id is stupid. The battery life is good. For not charging my phone for 9hrs ill be at 65 or 50%. The camrea it great also. It has the 4k live effect going on. Other then thats, thats the only two things i could say its good about this phone, and for it to cost 1000 plus tax that isnt saying much. I also heard apple might discontinue this phone due to low sells. So....",influenster
iphone,5,I donâ€™t have this phone but my brother dose it has the best Quality to take pictures itâ€™s a perfect size itâ€™s not to big or either small I recommend this whatâ€™s is so cool is you can open the phone just pulling you face in front of it,influenster
iphone,3,Honestly itâ€™s an okay phone but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s as much money as itâ€™s selling for. It is pretty much the same as all other iPhones just looks a little cooler than the generations before. Itâ€™s way to easy to crack in my opinion.,influenster
iphone,5,Omg I love this phone the camera is absolutely amazing. It is kind of on the expensive side but trust me it is totally worth buying. To me the camera and speaker are super important and this phone totally fulfilled my expectations.,influenster
iphone,5,I would love this new iPhone it looks and is awesome this would be a dream come true I have never won anything in my life and maybe this can be my chance that I have never had hopefully I get picked but if I donâ€™t get to get this iPhone X Iâ€™m happy with whatever else gets thrown my way!,influenster
iphone,4,"Got this as a Christmas present from my boyfriend. Itâ€™s a really nice phone, but not many apps are adjusted to it. I have dropped it about 2 times so far, and there is not even a scratch. One thing I noticed with my phone is that it lags during multitasking when on a phone call.",influenster
iphone,5,"Love love love this phone! Let me just say I was nervous to have a phone without a home button, but this phone has not let me down! I love the screen and just honestly everything about this phone! Works great and looks great too",influenster
iphone,4,Great phone but the OS can be buggy since the notch messes up the screen dimensions. I also wish it was a bit smaller so you can use one hand at all times. I cannot press all 4 corners with my thumb without adjusting my hand.,influenster
iphone,5,I love my phone! I use it for everything! I film my YouTube videos with it as well! Best iPhone yet! Plus I love not having a home button! Once you get used to not having it you won’t miss it at all ! Apple iPhone X,influenster
iphone,5,"I love this photo. The photo quality is amazing which I need with all the photos i take in a day. The extra capabilities I have is even better, i love being able to not use my fingers to open my phone when i have dirty hands.",influenster
iphone,4,I just recently upgraded to the iPhone X it’s way to use it just takes some time getting used to. I don’t like that it only comes on one size I would of loved to have gotten a bigger version. Other than that love the phone.,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my phone, it’s much better than the previous iPhone 7 I had, even though I enjoyed that as well while waiting for the upgraded stuff. So many new things, your personal emoji to use and all. Highly recommend!!",influenster
iphone,5,I would love to be gifted an Apple iPhone X. You can buy them at any phone retailer or even Walmart. They are very expensive but they are super easy to use and super light. They could be improved with better glass.,influenster
iphone,5,"This phone is outstanding compared to apples past products! While the price may seem high, the overall quality of the phone and it’s included features are definitely worth it. It’s sleek design and oled screen are outstanding!",influenster
iphone,5,"I’ve heard so many positive things about this phone! I’ve thought about getting it, unfortunately it’s just too expensive! The camera on it is remarkable! It looks like you’re taking photos with a professional camera.",influenster
iphone,5,"Very high price for a very good phone! And its worth every penny! I love my iphone X! Everyone looks to you like oh you have the iphone x! Its almost incredible the camera, the fastest it is! Everything!!",influenster
iphone,5,I’m a newbie for iPhones came from android. I was sceptic at first but once I dove in was easy and amazing . Not a total transformation from android once u figure out the phone but better experience.,influenster
iphone,5,"This is my ultimate #giftcrush !!! I would love to get this for Christmas!!! ❤️ Maybe Santa will be extra good to me this year! I love watching the online reviews about it, makes me excited to upgrade!",influenster
iphone,5,"I am so excited for a new I phone and I love screen, the size and all the features except the face recognition.  I am hoping for this for Christmas.  It's a little pricey but so worth it!!! Reccomend!",influenster
iphone,5,"My friend owns the iPhone X and it’s the best. I own a iPhone 8 that I love, but so wish I had the X. There’s a lot of new features that I love. I also like thats it’s the size of regular iPhones.",influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone X. I don’t like the price we are paying for it on ur plan. But i never have any issues. I love all the apps i can download, it allows me to message, and call whoever i need to.",influenster
iphone,5,Love my iPhone X. It took a little time to get used to some of the new gestures but it’s really a cool phone. Wished the launches a Plus size already but this is already a step in the right direction!,influenster
iphone,4,I recently switched from the galaxy S6 edge and it was a big difference coming over to apple. There’s something’s I can’t do with apple that I could with android but over all I’m satisfied!,influenster
iphone,5,"I love this cell phone! The missing home button has already been disabled after a while. Wonderful technology, which makes me always keep myself as a loyal customer of apple.",influenster
iphone,5,Love love love this phone! As a mom I mainly use my phone for taking pictures of my kids and the photos this phone takes look like they could be professional! I love everything about this phone.,influenster
iphone,5,Loved the iPhone X and the face-id works 10 times faster than touch -Id. The picture are beautiful and the portrait mode in incredible. It’s an amazing device. Apple iPhone X,influenster
iphone,4,"Before my most recent iPhone (the X), I had the Apple iPhone 8 Plus - 64GB - Gold. The X overall is a great phone, but for me, I’d rather have the 8 Plus back, which is why 4 stars. I like the Face ID, but I wish fingerprint was also offered because you actually have to stare at your phone for the face to work (obviously), but sometimes I just want to pick it up and open quick with my thumb. Also, when double clicking the side button for Apple Store purchases, I always end up taking a screenshot because the volume buttons are directly on the other side, so while clicking with my thumb, my pointer hits the volume down. I also like the round bottom button better than the “swipe up.” I also wish all iPhones had a clipboard like Samsung - Galaxy S6 With 32GB Memory Cell Phone - Black (sprint) (pretty much all Samsung’s to my knowledge), to hold more than one copied item at a time.",influenster

iphone,5,This phone is very great it don’t freeze the colors are great the emoji‘s are amazing and one thing I didn’t like about it is I dropped it one time and it broke The backside broke 😕,influenster
iphone,5,"I loved this phone. I recently upgraded to the Xs, and see no difference. The portrait mode is awesome, it has a sleek and slim design, and best of all comes with so much storage!",influenster
iphone,5,"A perfect phone for this updated life. A very sophisticated device from apple that is totally a screen. That can respond to touch, voice and even a glance. Very nice  Apple",influenster
iphone,5,"I got this phone for Christmas as a gift. Honestly, I wasn’t really excited because I had a working phone and felt that getting a new one,especially an expensive ome like this, is a wate of money. I still feel that way - I would never buy it for myself- it’s super expensive for a phone.However, I love usinh it. The biggest pro is the camera! Ughh... my photos look amazing and people always ask me whether I use a professional camera. There’s a “portrait” option on the camera that blurs the background and focuses on the objects so it makes it look like you used professional lighting. The face recognition is also useful - I don’t have to type my passwords anymore - it saves time. A con, however, is that the phone is pretty new and there’s little bugs that I’m guessing will be soft with the new iOs updates. Overall, amazing product if you can afford it but not a must have.",influenster
iphone,4,"I don’t like apple as a company. I think they definitely take advantage of their customers and coming out with a yearly iphone takes away the fun out of having a new phone because i simply does not last. However after 3 years of having my iphone 6s and really struggling because software/ tech loft in general updates so fast, I needed to keep up. I thought of getting the samsung or google phones but I ended up coming to apple as ultimately they have what the people need and that’s the ultimate technology. So far the main improvements of owing an iphone X was the better camera resolution, the bigger screen, the battery lasting longer. So nothing cray, just updated necessary to keep up with society really",influenster
iphone,4,The hype was real for this when it first came out and tbh it’s nothing different just the fact that it has Face ID and such but I mean it’s a really nice phone tho,influenster
iphone,5,"I’ve had my phone for about two weeks now. I switched over from the iPhone 7plus which in size was a bit of getting used to because my hands were so used to a bigger phone. My home button on my iPhone 7 however didn’t work for almost a year so I was already used to not having a home button when switching over. I love love LOVE how this color looks especially with the metallic look on the sides of the phone. I love the facial recognition especially how I can use it for Apple Pay. A lot of people say my mother and I look alike so I even tried to see if the camera would pick up that she was me and it didn’t!! LOVE IT lol. At first it was a little frustrating having to get used to the smaller keyboard and the swiping up for the multitasking option, having to learn how to use this phone was definitely a mission but I love my phone overall. I’m going to have to start wearing makeup though because, this camera? INSANE!",influenster
iphone,3,"I’m not very happy with this phone, especially with the incredibly steep price. When I first got the phone, I had an otter box case and glass screen protector put in the phone in store the moment I bought it. I’m one of those people who is super careful with their phones. I’ve had significant problems, I got a brand new phone $1000+ and off the batt I had issues. There were blackouts, freezes, random power off, etc. I went to Apple and they tried to give me a REFURBISHED phone. I paid for a BRAND NEW phone, it’s not working, and they try to give me a REFURBISHED phone, after they couldn’t seem to figure out what’s wrong with mine. It’s ridiculous. Apple is definitely no longer king in the tech community. You’re no longer paying for innovation and quality. You’re now just paying for the name. It’s ridiculous.",influenster
iphone,5,"I got my iPhone X about two weeks ago and am in love.  It's great to have the Face ID and the full screen phone.  The resolution is beautiful, and the camera is great.  I thought it would take forever to get used to without the home button, but I've already adapted.  I was messing around on my mom's phone, which is the 7, and I kept wanting to swipe up instead of using the home button.  it's crazy how you quickly you adapt.  I did have some issues with my Face ID not working.  Apple support was great, and I ended up having to go to the Apple store to get it fixed.  I was in and out in 20 minutes with a new phone.  Love Apple!",influenster
iphone,4,Alright so there are a lot of things that I LOVE about this phone. Let's start with the cons. Whenever I talk to someone on the phone it sounds like they're far away or their voice is being muffled so I have to have it on speaker anytime I talk to someone. Since that's not too often I'm able to look past it. Pros: Face recognition. Animojis. 4K camera. The camera is the best part. It's worth it for that alone. The video it shoots is incredible. The portrait mode is better than the iPhone 7 Plus too. I definitely recommend getting this phone if you're tossed up between an older version and this one.,influenster
iphone,5,"I purchased the Apple iPhone X a month or two after it came out and I absolutely love it! It is easily one of the best smartphones out there in my opinion. I can also say it is most definitely worth the hefty price tag. The OLED screen is absolutely stunning and very clear. The color pigment of the screen is stunning and very bright. The edge to edge glass is also a nice feature to have, it gives the screen a minimalistic and modern design.  The size is also excellent, small but the perfect size and the screen clarity is also excellent. The camera quality is close to that of a professional camera. I was blown away by the quality of a few photos I had taken when I first purchased this iPhone. It looked as if I had taken them on a Nikon or Canon. Overall, this was a purchase that was worth every penny. Apple made yet another excellent quality phone!",influenster
iphone,5,"Amazing!!! Just got my new iPhone and I’m totally in love with it! The display is so crystal clear and nice, the volume is definitely louder than the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, which I had previously. It does take some getting use to having to swipe up from the bottom since no home button and the same with multitask, but I’m already use to it. Also new spot for control center, but overall very pleased. Also super fast.",influenster
iphone,4,"I love my iPhone X. In many ways, it's so similar to the iPhones preceding this one. The noticeable changes are obviously the lack of a home key. I find the gestures to be intuitive and I got used to them within an hour of using the phone. Obviously, Face ID is a big change. I would say the failure rate is similar to touch ID with the benefit of it learning as you type in your passcode with failed attempts to recognize you, so it's always learning. The camera is great, which is the primary reason I got this phone. That and I didn't want the huge 8+. This is still comfortable enough to fit in my pocket. The screen size does make it hard to reach the corners one handed though. Still, I'm very happy with my phone.",influenster
iphone,5,"I love my new phone. I love the larger screen without having to get a plus that feels too large for me. Love the camera quality and love portrait mode on the camera for the selfie, allows to take better close up photos also. The animoji is also awesome and fun to send to people. Having my messages locked until it has my face recognized and shows me the messages is also great. I can see what I have without having to go in to each app and see the notifications but it also allows from others not seeing them.",influenster
iphone,4,"I honestly love my iPhone X and I’ve always been an Apple fan girl. However, I had a Samsung Note 8 for a while and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss it sometimes! I came back to iPhone after a year and it’s feels like I never left it. It’s all pretty much the same. I do love the new iOS 12 update and my battery life is amazing in comparison to my Samsung. The camera is wonderful. My only qualm is I wish we had an app drawer! after being able to organize all of my apps, it’s hard to look at all those folders/icons again! Otherwise, the phone is fast, camera is clear, and battery is wonderful! I’d recommend to anyone. :)",influenster
iphone,4,"Okay the price is ridiculous. Also, it really bothers me that Apple completely skipped over an iPhone 9 just because they wanted to an iPhone X to celebrate a decade - could've planned for that a whole lot better. But, I really do love the camera. It makes the most basic thing look so gorgeous on screen. That being said, not much else is impressive so if you don't want a super powerful camera, this phone doesn't have much else to offer.",influenster
iphone,3,"Honestly, this phone has been okay. Not my favorite and I really miss my 7. I do love the size of the screen, but the screen is made of a softer glass and more prone to scratches. With my previous iPhones I never had a screen protector and had them for over a year each. There were no scratches when I got my new phone. With this one I had the phone for 2 weeks and it was already scratched. I also do not care for the face recognition. It’s a neat function, but at the end of the day the fingerprint scanner was much more snappy and convenient. And I very much miss it!! Wouldn’t recommend this phone.",influenster
iphone,3,"i stood on line for this phone when it first came out. it was very expensive but i was able to use a payment plan with my carrier. it can be very difficult to learn how to use at first because you have to learn how to do simple functions that in the past required the home button. i do not think the face id is all the its cracked up to be, as i have many issues with it working everyday. i would not recommend this phone to others.",influenster
iphone,5,"Apple has REALLY went the extra mile. I absolutely love my iphone X. The facial recognition is pretty cool. Sometimes it lags and that can be a bit annoying but I still would't opt out of using it. I like the extra security that comes with it. The other big feature is no home button. It takes some getting used to but once you do, it's super natural. I don't know about anyone else, but anytime I get a new phone, tablet, or any new electronic device for that matter, I watch videos to figure out how they work. Saves me a lot of trail and error. I recommend doing it.",influenster
iphone,5,"The iPhone X is absolutely amazing. My favorite features are the Face ID and portrait mode on camera and that there’s no home button. These three features make the IPhone X an absolute necessity! Although, not being able to listen to music and charge you phone at the same time is a bummer. PS. I recommend getting a protective case and a screen protector due to its cost!   Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,"I recently upgraded from a 6 Plus and was unsure whether I would like this version better than the 8 Plus.  I’m really glad I decided to go with the X.  I LOVE the facial recognition feature, although it’s not 100% accurate.  It took awhile to get used to not having the home button, but I don’t miss it at all now.  The camera and photo settings are amazing.  As an amateur photographer, I sometimes use my phone instead.  The screen on the X is just as big as the screen on the 8+ so you don’t give up any space.  I highly recommend this phone!",influenster
iphone,2,"I know the iPhone X is all the hype and unfortunately I fell into it. I wish I would have kept my iPhone 6 Plus. I liked it just as well maybe more. I don’t like that they took the headphone port away just to sell back the wire to convert headphones to plug into the charging port. You can’t charge the phone and use headphones at the same time, lame! The only real difference is the Face ID which isn’t even that cool honestly. I am not happy with this phone, I shouldn’t have wasted so much money on it",influenster
iphone,5,"WOW, do I love this phone or what! At first I thought with the home button missing it would be impossible to get past and enjoy it, but after getting to use it for a few days it was no issue at all. THE BEST! THING ABOUT THIS PHONE IS THE CAMERA! Portrait mode will be your best friend! I took some photos at a wedding and most people thought it looked like a professional camera. In addition, the size is just right, it holds up great, and holds a charge fairly well. You have to get the iphone X!",influenster
iphone,5,"I absolutely love my iPhone X! I wasn’t sure if I would like it before I got it but the whole no home button thing took me like 20 min to get use to. It exceeded my expectations and it’s absolutely worth buying! The best iPhone I’ve had so far! But a lot of apps need to update to the new screen size, other than that love it so much!!! Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,"I had been wanting the X for awhile and when I broke my 7 plus on a water tubing trip on the 4th of July I legit went home and ordered online for in store pick up and made it to the mall with 20 mins to spare before closing for the holiday. I’ve had the X for a few months now and after a week or two of adjusting to no home button and no Touch ID, I really have come to love it. I do think I will always miss the Touch ID though. I can do without a headphone jack and use bluetooth.",influenster
iphone,5,"Apple continues to out-perform the competition. First of all, iOS is leaps and bounds ahead of the other operations systems, like android’s. The processing power is more than adequate for a smart phone and feels like it will have good longevity. Battery life is outstanding!! Lastly, the screen is crisp, clear and looks awesome.",influenster
iphone,5,This is an amazing iPhone I really love it it has many new stuff you can try many new things I think it's the best iPhone yet that they had made .Right now this is my favorite iPhone I'm really in love  with it I have learned new stuff and it's so entertaining. I can't explain the love I have for this phone it's amazing!!!,influenster
iphone,5,I just got my new iPhone X in the mail this morning and I love it! I got it through my xfinity service and I’m paying close to $90 a month for the phone and my service. After 22 months my phone will be payed off and I’ll only pay about $45 a month for my phone plan and that’s it! My favorite feature so far is the Animoji! It is just the cutest thing ever!,influenster
iphone,5,"Just got mine in the mail and so far it’s great. I had the 7plus before this one so in getting use to the smaller size, however the screen is much longer so it doesn’t feel like such a big difference to me. Facial recognition works! It works with my glasses and without. I even used it with a sheet mask on and it worked also.",influenster
iphone,5,"It's ten years since the iPhone was first unveiled and Apple has marked the occasion with a new iPhone that doesn't just jump one generation, it jumps several. Apple has leapt straight from iPhone 7 (via the iPhone 8, reviewed here) all the way to iPhone 10 (yes, that's how you are supposed to say it).",influenster
iphone,5,"I absolutely love my iPhone X! The camera on this thing is beyond amazing, especially using portrait mode, the pictures come out looking professionally taken. The face recognition is probably my favorite feature; because i loved Touch ID but adding the face recognition made it that much more amazing and convenient. I’ve always been an apple fan; but this is literally my most favorite iPhone I’ve ever owned. 1000000% recommend!",influenster
iphone,5,I absolutely love my new  Apple iPhone X ! It's the perfect size even with my little hands. We all know new phones are expensive and this one was a little more pricey but you get so much for your money. The phone took a couple days to get use to but in our world any questions I had about the phone were easily answered on a simple google search. I highly recommend it to any and all of my friends and family!,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone. Once you go apple, it’s hard to go to Android. The connectivity is just so helpful and useful. The camera quality of the X is awesome and the functions/features are great. At first, it was difficult to use the phone without the home button, but it’s definitely easy to get used to!",influenster
iphone,5,My iPhone 6s recently got water damage so I needed to upgrade. I chose to go with the iPhone X because I really liked the fact that it had a larger screen without being the plus. I got used to not having the home screen button pretty quickly!! Love this phone.,influenster
iphone,5,Really good phone. My friend has a phone like this and I fell in love with it. Has good quality camera and it has cool little hacks to it. I also love how big it is. But i kind of dis like that it doesn’t have a jack to it because if u don’t have Bluetooth headphones and you need a jack u need to carry another product to just use ur headphones but overall I love it and can over look the no jack thing.,influenster
iphone,5,"Apple’s iPhone X has a big, beautiful screen, one of the best camera systems you’ll find on a smartphone, fast performance, and wireless charging. Features like the Face ID facial recognition system, used primarily for unlocking the phone and authenticating in apps, genuinely change the way you interact with and use the phone—usually for the better. It’s Apple’s best and most forward-looking iPhone",influenster
iphone,5,"Pros: The face recognition works perfectly, it's a nice size, has a beautiful screen with lovely rich colours, everything works as it should. It has an amazing battery life, with super fast charging. The sound quality from the speakers on the phone is excellent.Cons: No jack port",influenster
iphone,4,"I think this might be my favorite iPhone so far. I like how sleek it looks, the camera is great, the battery lasts a very long time and the face detection is super helpful. I don't like how the back is glass though, because it just ups my chances of it cracking during a fall. I like that they took out the home button; I can't imagine ever going back to having to using a home button.",influenster
iphone,5,My # GiftCrush this season is the IPhone X! If you’re a person who is in love with electronics and always wanting the newest best products this is the perfect gift to get someone like a significant other. This phone is a little pricey but it’s because the phone is designed and perfected to work flawlessly for personal and business use! What’s your #GiftCrush this season?! #Influenster,influenster
iphone,5,"By far, my favorite iPhone to date. The screen size is amazing, while keeping the body of the phone similar to that of an iPhone 8 (not Plus model). The $1000 cost might be out of the price range of some people, but is well worth the price tag. Battery life is astounding, the OLED is bright and vibrant, both the front and rear facing cameras are among the best in the industry.",influenster
iphone,4,"I have a love hate relationship with this phone. When in perfect lighting conditions it can take amazing photos. But normal every day pictures of my kids being kids, are just a blur! It’s like it can’t focus! My iPhone 5c took better indoor pictures lol. Ill add a photo I took with it in portrait mode :)",influenster
iphone,5,"The camera quality is splendid. Although, U miss the home button and the 4.7 size. For my petite hands that was the most convenient size. I think it has an improved bisyals, audio and battery time too.",influenster
iphone,5,"I am IN LOVE with my phone. I upgraded from the iPhone 6. It took very little time to get used to all the new features but now I can't think of a reason that a home ""Button"" was ever needed. I have the white one and it looks like a off white/greyish tone which I love SO much, I didn't really want it to be a BRIGHT white. Still on the hunt for a perfect case to go on it... it feels and looks so elegant as is!",influenster
iphone,5,"I really enjoy my X. I thought it would be difficult to get use to the no home screen, but it was fairly easy to get adjusted to. My mom and my brother also did really well adapting to the change too on their own phones. My mom is no techie but she did REALLY well for the knowledge about phones. It’s easy to learn the new functions and the picture quality is amazing.",influenster
iphone,4,"This phone was everywhere when it first launched, and for good reason too. I mean the price is kinda up there, but they're so techy and nice to use. The animoji feature is so fun. The face recognition to unlock is so easy. At first it was hard to transition over but once you get used to it. It's such a wonderful phone, it takes such nice pictures as well.",influenster
iphone,5,"Just got this baddie for Mother’s Day and can I just say wow, the screen is beautiful and it all just flows so wonderfully I can’t get over how great this phone is. I will say that you should invest in a good glass screen protector and case because this thing is all glass so that’s kinda scary.",influenster
iphone,5,"I actually have the XS, which I upgraded to when my 6s tragically died a watery death. I love love LOVE this phone! The camera is my favorite feature since I do a lot of work on social media. The missing home button didn’t take long to get used to at all.",influenster
iphone,5,"I love a phone that fits in my small hands and I never upgrade to just get the new best thing. So this was a first...I upgraded just to upgrade. I am not disappointed. The facial recognition is intuitive and fast, camera is upgraded with amazing portrait options and 4K video is a reality. I am just getting into the features but if you are charging me 1200 for a phone, when I could buy a new laptop, it had better live up to expectations and then go beyond. So far my fav feature is the enlarged screen and intuitive lighting. Believe it or not, I can now browse my phone as it dims itself when putting the baby to bed without him getting distracted. Mom win!",influenster
iphone,5,"Apple is life! The products are so user friendly, and the camera is amazing! Apple has created yet another great product. I do feel like since the Apple X is $1000 it should come with the AirPods.",influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone X. It feels like a bigger phone that still fits in my hand. The swipe and face features allow for such fast use, switching between screens and such. There are way less bugs in the iPhone X than Iâ€™ve gotten in previous iPhones. And the camera is amazing. I love this phone.",influenster
iphone,5,"I am absolutely in love with this phone. The picture quality is great, and I love the 256GB storage option. As someone who keeps a lot of pictures and makes slideshows and minimovies, it definitely comes in handy! It took a while to get used to not having a home button, but after about three days, I didn't even really notice.",influenster
iphone,5,At first I was sad to go to the X cause it meant no more home button. But then I got over it and have never looked back. I enjoy how fast and easy everything it compared to having a home button. Iâ€™ve only had my phone since August but Iâ€™m satisfied for the time being. Donâ€™t really see the point in the xr or whatever the newer series are called.,influenster
iphone,5,I donâ€™t own this myself but it seems like an awesome product! My friends have it & I really really want it! It has an upgraded camera from what I know & I currently only have the iPhone 7! So I donâ€™t even have portrait mode!,influenster
iphone,5,Very easy to use! Sleek and the features are amazing. It is worth the high price tag. I love the camera  Apple iPhone X t fits easy in my pocket and purse or even a clutch. I had the iPhone 7 Plus but sometimes it was too big,influenster
iphone,5,"By far the greatest iPhone ever invented! Sleek, smart and sexy (until the new ones come out tomorrow - Apple Keynote!) I did however changed the device twice because my battery was draining pretty bad considering itâ€™s a brand new phone. Apple staff were super quick to fix it! All I can say is that I cannot live without this phone else Iâ€™d be writing reviews on papers (which isnâ€™t too bad!)",influenster
iphone,4,This holiday season I wish to get the new iPhone X! I've been wanting a new phone for a while now and hope my family gets it for me! Apple products are personally very easy to use and I say this because I've tried other cellphones besides Apple. I just love the easy navigation through apple and the way its system work! Apple iPhone X,influenster
iphone,5,Itâ€™s definitely a good phone. Definitely in my top 5. The screen is very fragile so be careful with it and PLEASE donâ€™t be that person that doesnâ€™t get a case and a temper glass because you think youâ€™re not gonna break it ðŸ˜‚ cause you WILL.ZAGG - InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector for AppleÂ® iPhoneÂ® 6 Plus and 6s Plus - Clear,influenster
iphone,5,"LOVE it so much more than my old iPhone 7+!!! The feel and aesthetic is just so premium and luxe, I got one for myself and one for my best friend. We both love recording and taking pictures at concerts or for whatever haha. I am super impressed by how they perform and how quickly it is to adjust to the new features and or differences.",influenster
iphone,4,The Apple iPhone X can do so many cool things! It unlocks by face recognition and is so easy to use once you get the hang of it! it's on the expensive side i think it's $31 a month plus other fees and packages. but one thing that bothers me is once or twice it shuts off and doesn't turn back on until an hour later or so.,influenster
iphone,5,"First of all the camera on this product is amazing! The video is so high quality! It you want to vlog on it your footage would be perfect, your instagram pictures will be on fleek, and your snapchats will be popping. But the camera isn't the only good feature in the phone there are many more I totally recommend it to everyone.",influenster
iphone,5,"Got this phone after my 5s so def an upgrade. Its not hard to adjust to the size or the fact that there’s not a home button. Personally I love the screen! It’s super long and the resolution is great. I was considering the iPhone 8 before purchasing this one, but I’m soooooo satisfied with the ten! I’m glad I didn’t get the 8!",influenster
iphone,4,Recently purchased the iPhone XS and am very satisfied with the outcome. It’s a great phone and extremely fast. Only problems I have are pet peeves. Like Face ID not working in landscape mode and the batter percentage not being shown until you go to the command center. Other than that it’s a great phone and I would recommend.,influenster
iphone,5,I LOVE my X. it has been perfect for me since day one. I have a little girl who likes to play with my phone and it really hasn’t had any issues. iphones are always expensive BUT totally worth it in my opinion !,influenster
iphone,5,"I like the phone, I know that people say that it glitch’s but it works just fine. I’ve had the phone x for almost a year and i can say that it hasn’t glitch on me. Only when there was a software update. Over all I recommend you get this phone. I know it’s costs a lot but it’s worth it. So I recommend you get this phone.",influenster
iphone,5,Love my IphoneX! Such a unique phone that feels so great in your hand - the phone itself is so beautiful and really is just seamless - the phone has exceeded my expectations and would recommend anyone thinking about getting it making the jump!,influenster
iphone,5,"I love this phone. It’s smaller than my 6 plus. It was pricey but I got it anyway. I wish they would’ve kept the storage choices the same. Eliminating the 64g was not the best decision. I wouldn’t have released the 8 at the same time either. Not the best decision. I love the phone and I am an Apple everything person. MacBook, iPhones, iPads, etc.",influenster
iphone,5,The iPhone X is so user friendly and worth the expense. It is very reliable and the camera takes drastically clearer pictures. I like not having a home button. It eliminates the possibility it could become damaged or stuck. I also like that the screen encompasses the entire phone front. I would highly recommend!,influenster
iphone,5,"For all those I phone lovers our there, you absolutely need to invest in this phone! The batter life is significantly better and the wider screen is an added plus. This phone is waterproof and my favorite feature is the portrait mode on the camera. It literally looks like a professional photograph. Love this phone!",influenster
iphone,5,I love my iPhone X. This was my valentines day gift from my husband and I love it so much. The camera is incredible and It's too much easier to use with the new and amazing features. I love the better and improved face recognition its works great each time. This has got to be my best phone yet. I love it,influenster
iphone,5,What an amazing phone! I just upgraded from an IPhone 7 to and X and it has me floored. It’s a beautiful design and absolutely wonderful screen clarity! The price was steep but I would say it was worth it. So sleek.,influenster
iphone,5,"Absolutely in love with my new iPhone X. I do not like the price tag, but the features, speed, camera functions are amazing.! i love that it is small like an iPhone 7, yet the screen is that of an iPhone 7 Plus. The sideways cam is too cool with the dual functionality. It does get some getting used to just because the gestures are different and no longer a home button. But more phones now a days no longer have physical button so might as well jump on the band wagon:)",influenster
iphone,5,I'm too excited to get my hands on the news iphone X. Getting it for free that comes with my telecom plan. The 256gb is currently out of stock and I am on waiting list. Hope to get it very soon. I just can't wait! Apple iPhone X I'll will be reviewing the iphone x as soon as I get it.,influenster
iphone,5,I never had this phone before but I would rate this phone full stars because my friend has it and the camera is great. it is reliable and I wish I had it. in my opinion the best feature is everything. I would recommend this to other people if I had it myself. Also this phone can help me with school.,influenster
iphone,5,"I've had iPhones for several years now and have had the X for almost a year.  I love it, but I'll be honest I definitely dont use it to its full potential.  I forget half the things it does sometimes and end up still using it for the basic functions of internet, phone & texting.",influenster
iphone,5,GREAT PHONE! Amazing capabilities and camera. Portrait mode rocks. Makes taking photos more enjoyable now that the quality is higher and more professional. This phone is great! Can’t wait to upgrade to the MAX.,influenster
iphone,5,I just want to say a couple things. Yes Apple will always own the fact that they don’t build the experience around cool new features or technology but they definitely design the experience FIRST and then decide what technology to achieve the result. THIS phone brings great features to the hands of the user in such an intuitive way it was almost hard for me to notice what is new.,influenster
iphone,5,"I’ve had this phone for a week now and I love it. I was die hard Android couldn’t stand apple products and serious about it. My phone broke last week and the only thing on stock was apple. I figured if I was going apple I was going all the way. I love the screen, colors, and the camera.",influenster
iphone,4,"To be honest, I don’t like the face recognition as much as I liked the fingerprint. The camera is great, but it drives me crazy that you have to download an app to take a photo large enough to fill the screen. The resolution is great, but the size is the issue I struggle with.",influenster
iphone,5,"The iPhone X has been a great upgrade for me. The Face ID is quickly, response, and offers a great level of security for the phone and secure apps. There is a slight learning curve to the new gestures on the phone, but they end up becoming very natural. You’ll forget about the home button very quickly.",influenster

iphone,5,I just bought the 256GB iPhone Xs in Gold and I am loving it! I upgraded from a 16GB iPhone 6s so the processing is amazingly fast in comparison. Face ID and no home button has been so easy to get used to surprisingly.,influenster
iphone,5,I had this phone since December I love it the face ID is a little difficult sometimes but other than that I really love the phone. I would recommend people who are very tech savvy to but the iphone X.,influenster
iphone,5,I love my new iPhone X it is way better than the other iPhones out now I would not be able to go back to the old one because the iPhone X is more advanced.  The phone also Thales amazing pictures. Apple iPhone X,influenster
iphone,5,Absolutely love APPLE PRODUCTS! I currently have the IPhone X and it has been through so much! Iâ€™ve dropped it multiple times no cracks on the screen! My son also put my phone in the dogs water bowl for a good 20 seconds fully submerged & it still works! I love my IPhone X! :) <3,influenster
iphone,4,I absolutely love this phone. I am a long time apple user and this phone is my favorite yet! I love that there are less buttons and it is almost bezel-less. I was worried about the Face ID as someone who wears contacts and glasses but it recognizes me no matter what.,influenster
iphone,5,"Honestly, the best phone ever! Love love love portrait mode! Very easy to use, light weight and if youâ€™re not a fan of the plus size - but still want a good phone get this one! I encourage everyone to have it!",influenster
iphone,5,Iâ€™m not sure why everyone was so against the X. I get that itâ€™s super pricey but that aside its amazing. Iâ€™ve had mine since they came out and I love it so much. The camera is definitely my favorite part!,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone X, its full screen and does the face unlock. Camera quality is the best. I am my very own photographer. Price is high on these phones but I know its worth it. I've never had a problem with any of my Apple products! You will LOVEEEE!!!!!!!",influenster
iphone,5,I love Apple so much. I have never had Samsung or Android. No judgement against them but Apple is my favorite. I love the glass back and the double vertical camera. While  the X/10 is expensive it is totally worth it. Amazing phone and I love mine.,influenster
iphone,5,"i didn’t think i would like this phone coming from a 7+ because it’s smaller. however the size is perfect for your hands! a little expensive, but the camera on this thing is better than my DSLR... so if you like to take photos & your on the fence GET IT!",influenster
iphone,3,Personally I wouldn’t recommend specially not for 1000 does everything any other phone could do for way less.🤷🏻‍♀️ luckily camera is still one of the best overall apple give me something someone hasn’t already done Wouldn’t recommend to a friend,influenster
iphone,5,Very addicting phone. You never want to put it down. The facial recognition is extremely convenient and easy to get used to. It doesn’t feel as heavy as it looks either. Small enough to fit in your back pocket snug and beautiful camera quality.,influenster
iphone,5,"Absolutely in love with the bigger screen, camera, and new ios features. I recently switched from android to apple so I don’t know how the x compares to say the 8 or a 7, but my apps run much smoother and I’m impressed by the length of battery.",influenster
iphone,5,Just got this phone last week and it’s amazing! I love the emoji active feature and how there’s no home button! They also have so many new features locked into this phone. My battery lasts forever!!! I highly recommend even though it’s pricey!,influenster
iphone,5,I LOVE my iPhone X. It runs smoothly and the optics are perfection. Face ID is so convenient when I have dirty hands I don’t have to worry about my fingerprints not reading. It’s got a good steady weight to it and the camera is the absolutely best yet.,influenster
iphone,5,"The best iPhone that has come out this far! The camera is amazing and I love the Face ID aspect, it makes everything that much easier! I have doing the phone plan through Apple and got such a better deal in comparison to my Verizon carrier.",influenster
iphone,5,"I was torn between the X and the 8 for quite some time, but I'm so glad I went for the X! The battery life is great and I love all the new updates. I don't even miss the home button! I also don't have that many problems with the face ID",influenster
iphone,5,"I’ve been with the Apple family for awhile and this product exceeded my expectations. I made sure once they announced it to preorder ASAP. I love the convenience of Face ID, Animoji, Apple Pay, and etc. A great phone definitely worth the money. I have a review via YouTube of this product.",influenster
iphone,4,"I love the phone, but does have some issue even when I update it, such as an issue I am having right now which I have had in the past, I do not get notifications. I have tried everything to fix the issue and it still keeps happening.",influenster
iphone,5,I currently have this phone and I think itâ€™s the best iPhone that has ever been out it is so easy to do the things you love and the camera is amazing it is expensive but itâ€™s something you can splurge on and I think itâ€™s worth it,influenster
iphone,4,Great update from the iPhone 8! The camera is better than most digital cameras currently on the market. The larger screen makes it easier to read and video watching is seamless. The iOS system is fast and is completely intuitive.,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone X. I was concerned about missing the home button, but Iâ€™m pleased with how fluid they made the functions. The Face ID unlocks my phone much quicker than the thumbprint scanner. And the photo quality is amazing!",influenster
iphone,5,Really love this phone! I have had it for a while now and I keep finding out more and more things out about it that I love! My favorite part is the Face ID. I love that it is a really sleek design and looks supper high quality!,influenster
iphone,5,I rate this product a 5 because it has really good reviews and I really want one. I feel like the best feature on the iPhone X would be the new camera. This phone is a bit pricey for an iPhone but I feel like it may be worth it.,influenster
iphone,5,"I absolutely love this phone, I love the Face ID feature, the quality of the camera is amazing, love the portrait feature, the size of the phone is just right, not too big, not too small, itâ€™s very expensive but worthwhile.",influenster
iphone,5,"I have been in love with all Apple products for quite some time now, and this one doesnâ€™t disappoint! I love how it feels in my hand and how the screen takes up the whole front of the phone. It is pricey, but itâ€™s worth it.",influenster
iphone,5,I want to get this as gift for myself I need a phone  ðŸ“² I canâ€™t wait to get for myself ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ i just love apple products  Iâ€™ve seen all of review on it I canâ€™t wait to get for Christmas ðŸŽ„ does anyone else like the iPhone X ? #GiftCrush ðŸ“²ðŸ“²ðŸ“²ðŸ“²ðŸ“²ðŸ“²ðŸ“²ðŸ“²,influenster
iphone,5,I love my IPhone X!! The speed is amazing and I have plenty of storage on my on phone. The camera is way better then any previous models. I do believe the price tag is to heavy though.  Apple iPhone X,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my iPhone. First, it took me a while to get used to not having a home button, but it is great not having one. I love the camera so much and the battery lasts really long.  Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,I haven’t gotten this phone but I know others who have. The simple fact is the technology these days are so advanced and it’s fascinating that a phone unlocks to the face of the phones keeper. I hope that one day I can get one!,influenster
iphone,4,Okay. I am on the side of the Apple followers. But when it comes to this new iPhone I’m just not a huge fan. I don’t really like the fact that there’s no more home button. I prefer the older versions for sure!,influenster
iphone,5,"I love my IPhone X, for the longest time I wanted a bigger screen but hated how big the IPhone plus was and that I have small hands. I love that the iPhone X is the same size as the IPhone 8 but with a larger screen.",influenster
iphone,5,My husband recently bought this phone and it’s great. I like the new features and it takes perfect crisp clear pictures. I have the iPhone 7 and happy with it. I’m definitely going to upgrade come due time.,influenster
iphone,5,This phone is seriously incredible!! I upgraded from the iPhone 6s straight to this phone and I couldn’t be happier. I’ve wanted the Apple iPhone X ever since the rumors had started coming out and now I have it. The camera is absolutely incredible and I use it almost every day. The main reason I was in love with this phone is the look and the screen. The OLED display is so bright and clear especially compared to my old iPhone 6s. I don’t regret my purchase one bit and I am extremely happy to have gotten this phone. Its the perfect fit for my hand and I don’t sacrifice screen size for the overall size of the phone. I get the plus size screen with the phone size of a normal iPhone.,influenster
iphone,3,"I bought the Iphone X a couple months after it came@out and wasn’t fully happy with it, i’ve been an apple fan since the first one came out and this one to me was their worst.. slow, froze so many times",influenster
iphone,5,I LOVE the new look to the iPhone. I want one so bad. It’s so beautiful. I love how there’s no home button. The quality on the phones camera is just out of this world. I would recommend this to others.,influenster
iphone,5,I’ve had the iPhone X for about 2 months now and absolutely love it! Finally Apple has come to the upgraded technology of today. I love the full touch screen and facial recognition features and the sound is so much louder than earlier models! The camera quality is amazing and it has really cool features hidden inside! I see many improvements going forward like removing the notch on the top or making larger models and even putting a fingerprint sensor on the touchscreen but that is for future models.,influenster
iphone,5,"Not only is this one of the coolest and best iPhone ever, but it is quiet expensive. Regardless of price, the iPhone X is amazing at photos, playing games, and doing internet browsing on a big screen.",influenster
iphone,5,"This phone its self is amazing my dad has it and  I love it , I try to get on it every chance I get I  love love LOVE the phone its amazing the way it looks and the way it takes pictures it is so nice and amazing I love it ITS TO DIE FOR I WOULD TREADE IT IN FOR ANYTHING",influenster
iphone,5,I love my iPhone X! It was a little pricey but totally worth all of the convenience features! I love the face recognition. Face recognition is even used when accessing my credit cards or auto filling my passwords.,influenster
iphone,5,I would love to get this. I love that it is slightly smaller than my iPhone 7plus yet the screen is bigger. Itâ€™s amazing. I also love the face unlock feature. I canâ€™t wait to be able to charge my phone wirelessly.,influenster
iphone,5,I actually Iâ€™m new to iPhone Shocker! So my first new real iPhone is the iPhone XR I got the coral one and Iâ€™m pleasantly pleased and surprised how easy and fast it was to get it up and running.,influenster
iphone,5,Amazing product apple created here. The picture resolution is amazing so you donâ€™t even need a professional camera which makes your life less expensive. Easy to use at any age. Highly recommend,influenster
iphone,5,"This is actually my favorite phone that apple has came up with! I bought me and my boyfriend one and we canâ€™t live without it. Itâ€™s great, durable and water proof! Everything you can ask for!",influenster
iphone,4,"I love my iPhone X, however I do find that the changes to the iOS system and the changes to how you open and close apps, or how you screenshot differently do take some time to get used too.",influenster
iphone,5,I love my iPhone X. Took some getting use to without having a home button but I love it. The camera quality is amazing ðŸ˜» and the new picture functions help capture those perfect memories!,influenster
iphone,5,I really love my iPhone X. At first I was unsure of all the different changes because of not having a button anymore but I have no issues! I got it when it was fairly new still and I did have a few issues getting out of particular apps but the update has fixed that already! I love that it recognizes my face to get into password protected apps and websites! Itâ€™s so handy and it keeps my security when Iâ€™m not near my phone so no one can read my notifications! Itâ€™s super fast and the camera is honestly better than my dslr sometimes!!! I love it!,influenster
iphone,5,I would love to review this product and give detailed information about the product. I've heard so many good things about this phone and would like to talk more in depth about it,influenster
iphone,5,I love my iPhone X. The most important thing for me to love was the camera and itâ€™s exceptional. I use many cameras at my disposal and Iâ€™m glad my phone camera is amazing.,influenster
iphone,5,"I love i phones thru  make my busy life easier. I love,the,color. Even though I do not own an i phone I would most definently love to have this one.  Apple iPhone X",influenster

iphone,5,"Like all Apple products this is wonderful. An unparalleled design, elegant, practical, simple but beautiful. The potential of this intelligent slide makes it the best #GiftCrush for this Christmas.",influenster
iphone,5,"Itâ€™s alright, I like it more than other iPhones I have had in the passed but itâ€™s only upside is better speakers and the pled display, all other features are the same as all the other phones",influenster
iphone,5,"Have had my iPhone X since January and I absolutely LOVE it! The camera quality is amazing, so many beautiful photos with portrait mode as well! Definitely recommend ðŸ˜Š",influenster
iphone,5,Ok so I was skeptical at first with the new Face ID and the screen change.  Iâ€™m a die hard Apple fan and I put off getting the iPhone X because I wasnâ€™t too sure that I would care for it but Iâ€™m in love.  I love the new portrait editing that it has and it takes amazing video and photos.  I love the comfort of holding in my hand.  I think the plus was just slightly too big and I found that I dropped my phone frequently.  This phone fits nicely in my hand.  The quality of video (watching) is much better than the previous phones.  I tried the Face ID with my eye closed and it doesnâ€™t unlock.  Iâ€™ve tried it on my kids too whom do have a resemblance to me and it doesnâ€™t unlock for them either.  All in all I have to say itâ€™s a great phone and Iâ€™m glad I made the upgrade.,influenster
iphone,5,"This is such a great new device for anybody who is willing to learn new features and gestures to get the most out of technology. The design is so sleek and gorgeous too! It's similar to the 8, but with a better camera",influenster
iphone,5,"Best iPhone ever!!! Yo tenÃ­a el iPhone 7p y se lo terminÃ© regalando a mi esposo porque era muy grande y sentÃ­a que la tecnologÃ­a no era muy adelantada, ademÃ¡s de q solo tenÃ­a 32g de memoriaðŸ˜‘. Tuve un tiempo con el galaxy 8, no es un mal telÃ©fono pero cuando vi la cÃ¡mara y la calidad de las fotos decidÃ­ volver a Apple y no me arrepiento. Tengo el ecosistema completa y para grabar mis tutoriales, fotos de mis maquillajes ect es lo mejor.",influenster
iphone,5,"I am one of those donâ€™t fix it if it ainâ€™t broken type of people so Iâ€™ve been holding on to my Apple iPhone 6s Plus without upgrading because it did its job. It took a crap a few months ago so I finally upgraded to the Apple iPhone X. I am so glad I waited to upgrade to this one because itâ€™s amazing! The screen is just about as big as my Plus was with the edge to edge screen, but the phone itself is smaller so it actually fits in my pockets. The camera quality is beyond superb and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever need a regular camera again. Itâ€™s so multi functional that it was definitely worth the hefty price tag. I highly recommend it for anyone needing an upgrade!",influenster
iphone,5,"Love this phone! The camera is amazing and the technology canâ€™t be topped.If youâ€™re looking for a new phone in the new year, this is it! Although, it is expensive... but worth it! I like to think about it as a personal investment.",influenster
iphone,4,"The product is very well adapted. I think that for it to be a 10 year anniversary device, Apple really outdid themselves. Affordability was a tad unattainable but if you can, it is very easy to use. I would definitely recommend the device to a friend. There are so many neat added features to this device, that have not been on previous devices, that make the iPhone X unlike the rest! Anyone looking for a new cellular device to exceed your games, internet or photography needs in life; the iPhone X is the way to go!",influenster
iphone,5,I love this phone so much.i have this phone right now and I think it’s amazing. It is very expensive but it’s worth it. It is very reliable.it takes longer to charge but oh doesn’t run out of battery easily.,influenster
iphone,5,Hello I came according your product and I wanted to see if this product is as great as it says! I want to test and promote this product for everyone! Please let me test and review,influenster
iphone,5,"I looooove my new IPhone X! It honestly is the best phone I’ve had in gosh.... uh EVER!? Yeah. It has so many cool feature on it. It’s not too big and it’s not too small. It’s a big larger than the 8 but smaller than the plus sizes. The camera is absolutely incredible and has a portrait mode setting that makes it seems like you’ve suddenly become a professional photographer overnight 😜 I don’t mind. It have the home button, you get used too it! Love this phone so much! Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,4,"I like this phone very much! It’s a very advanced piece of technology. I love the photos it takes, the Animojis endlessly entertain me, and I find that some of the tools and features are very useful. The one thing that I don’t like so much on it is that every time I want to open my phone, I have to look at it (which really does sound lazy, but I just don’t like waiting for it to recognize me). Other than that though, I highly recommend getting it if you’re into this new technology.",influenster
iphone,5,"This phone is amazing!! It takes the BEST photos. You can rely on this phone to take amazing pictures!! When you first get the phone, it's pretty confusing but you'll get the hang of it. I totally recommend getting this phone!! #iphonex #phone #amazing  #techie",influenster
iphone,4,This phone is pretty snazzy 😂 The camera quality is so clear😍😍 And btw face I'd is nothing new😂 they just have way better face id😂 the battery is decent and the display is amazing 😍 it should be more affordable though 😂 but overall an amazing phone 👏👏👏,influenster
iphone,4,I HADDDDD to have this phone! I mean I get every phone!!! I should have gotten then 8 instead! I mean don’t get me wrong the phone good....NOT WORTH The price but good! I could do without the Face ID..I need my fingerprint back! Back camera is AMAZING...front camera not so much! screen is great!! That’s one feature that I love!! And the phone is too small!! Coming from an Plus to a...idk what to call this! I always use autocorrect 🤣🤣🤣,influenster
iphone,5,"For starters, look at these photos. This camera is to die for! The focus is incredible! I love this phone so much! It’s the best! It took a second to adjust to the new controls but so far, no complaints at all! Why? Because it’s Apple and they’re the greatest!",influenster
iphone,5,"This phone is amazing! I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6S plus and I’m so happy I did! The camera is awesome, the speakers are LOUD, and the graphics are sweet. There’s lots of cool little features also. It’s on the more expensive side but overall it’s a great phone for the price!",influenster
iphone,5,"I love this phone so much. I woke up at 1:50am to preorder this phone and I waited in line the day it came out. I have yet to have an issue with this phone. It has a great camera, screen resolution and let’s not mention Face ID. I would recommend this to anyone, even you Android users.",influenster
iphone,5,"Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone X sets a new gold standard for the next decade of iPhones. Coming hot on the heels of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus the iPhone X steals the show despite sharing nearly identical internal hardware. The X (pronounced “ten”) is a beautiful, modern sculpture, and iPhone owners finally have a reason to show off their phones again.",influenster
iphone,4,I am a die hard iPhone user. I started with the iPhone 4 and have been hooked ever since. I recently upgraded to the iPhone X. I have the iPhone forever plan through Sprint. I love the ease of use and the options to send payments through text messages. My only complaint is that the screen is extremely fragile. Within a day of receiving the phone I noticed a hairline scratch.,influenster
iphone,5,I have had this phone for a month now and i must say that it is my favorite iPhone ever !!! I loved the size of my plus but where the screen is the same size i don’t notice a huge difference and i think I like the overall size of this phone better. I think it’s a very professional and adult looking phone as well. The camera is great and i love not having a home button !!!,influenster
iphone,5,"I would love to get an Iphone so badly. I believe that this phone would be a huge step up from the phone that I have. If you're thinking about getting someone a new phone as a gift, then you should definetly get this product. It is literally the best phone of the year. If I could get one, I know I would get this one without a doubt. Go Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,In one word the most amazing phone ever. So first things first the phone unlocks with your face and another person won’t be able to see your notifications unless you show your phone your face. The design is extraordinary and very beautiful and best feature of it is the Animoji.,influenster
iphone,3,"So, my boyfriend has this phone and of course I spent a few days consumed with it and seeing all of its new features. Needless to say, a lot of impressive upgrades. But, I can't get over the fact that there isn't a home button. Whatever Apple does next, they should include a button somewhere.",influenster
iphone,5,I’m a huge fan of Apple and all of their products. I started out with Apple before they even had the iPod Touch and I’ve stuck with them since then. I currently have the iPhone X and it’s fantastic. The facial ID works better than I imagined and not having a home button hasn’t been a problem. It’s a lot of money but great to have.,influenster
iphone,5,"When I first got this phone, I was disappointed in the size. To be honest, I thought my 7 Plus was better and I would wish I kept it. The more I used it and realized all the features it has, I began using the phone to its potential. Now, I can't go back to any phone with the exception of the new iPhone X + (plus) lol.. :)",influenster
iphone,5,I love this phone. I have had and iPhone since I don't know how long and they have later. My iPhone x has a wonderful camera quality and is amazing. I highly recommend for anyone because it is very easy to use and I just love it so so much.,influenster
iphone,5,So far this phone is really good. I like the updated screen with crisp clear images and graphics. I like how the camera is and gives more features and the memory they have on this phone is a step up then the older iPhones. I also like how it is different in technology. But again the price is a tad more then the older iPhones,influenster
iphone,5,"Jumped from the iPhone 6s to the iPhone X and I am in love. The camera is just amazingly amazing, the phone is very slim so easy to fit inside my purse and there is so much space!! I love everything about the phone, from the screen to the way the apps are displayed to the face recognition ID. Perfect, highly recommend.",influenster
iphone,5,When my original phone was acting up I was debating on the 8 or the x. I went to apple and started playing around with them and I fell in love with the x. It’s easier to use then I thought the camera is amazing and it’s the perfect size. If you are tired of your phone and are looking to get this would I recommend it 100%,influenster
iphone,5,Received this item on launch day and I haven’t had any issues with this phone. My favorite part about the phone is the facial recognition. I was tired of using my fingerprint for everything. I would totally recommend this phone.,influenster
iphone,4,I would love to have an IPhone X because I have had really good experiences with Apple in tge past and I just overall in general love apple and their design and apps and just everyrhing all about them. The only thing that I dont like is that its missing google and YouTube but you can easily just download those on there,influenster
iphone,5,"I would definitely recommend buying it! If you are interested in it you can get it at the nearest Apple store! It has tons of new features such as Animoji and exclusive backgrounds! I personally think that it is better than the Samsung phones! Again, I totally recommend buying it no doubt!Apple iPhone X😊",influenster
iphone,5,"I’m really liking the iPhone X. The face recognition function is pretty neat and convenient. At first it wasn’t easy to adjust to not having a middle button but after a week, I no longer missed it. There’s not too many changes but I do like that it’s much smaller and thinner than the iPhone 7 Plus.",influenster
iphone,5,"This thing looks amzing!!! I really wanna try it out, so i could tell everyone how great it is, and make them buy it.  This phone is just to exspensive for me, so sadly, i will never get my hands on it. On my yt channel, if i ever do get it (i doubt it), i would say al the great things.",influenster
iphone,5,"I really like the Apple products, and I am the person that is so excited about to be fashionable. I payed $1000 plus taxes, I think it is expensive but once again I was surprised by the photo quality that in my opinion the Apple is the best and now with the resistance that IPhone X has.",influenster
iphone,5,"i love my new phone so much! i know it's a bit pricey, but i promise it makes every dollar worth it. the face recognition is occasionally unreliable, but it is pretty cool and all my friends would agree. the camera quality is amazing and i wouldn't trade this phone for anything.",influenster
iphone,4,"I love my IPhone X, but I guess I got bad luck. Mine gets overheated just watching videos. It shuts down on its own and it’s a scratch magnet! On the other hand, it has a beautiful look, feel, and hardware. I do wish it came in gold. It has an amazing camera with fun features.",influenster
iphone,4,I love all my Apple products. The only downside I have to this phone is the battery life! I love that the screen is large. The facial recognition is great with very few times it doesn’t register my face. The home button was a challenge for me a few days but now it’s routine.,influenster
iphone,5,"I got the Iphone X as soon as it came out! BEST DECISION EVER!!! I love the face ID and being able to just look at the screen to make purchases, etc. It took some getting used to since there is not a home button, but now I can't imagine going back to having a home button.",influenster
iphone,5,I love apple products and i bought this phone becuase i needed an upgrade and this phone is the best it hold so much memories i love the quality of the camera it takes the best pictures and videos,influenster
iphone,5,The best thing of this iPhone is the portrait mode of pictures. It can be a bit frustrating because face recognition is harder than it looks. It doesn’t verify that much at night or if its on a desk and you lean over the desk it will not recognize you. It literally needs to be in-front of your face.,influenster
iphone,4,"So I got this because my spouse raced on how great it was. Granted it has some cool features but the price is ridiculous. It has face recognition which is cool, but the phone itself is super slippery. The phone falls all the time so make sure you get a good case for it.",influenster
iphone,5,This is amazing. I upgraded to this one IPhone X. I used to have IPhone 7 Plus. And I got used to it. It meet my expectations and it’s absolutely fabulous. It doesn’t have any limitation. There is no need for anything in this phone than just rock and enjoy the features.,influenster
iphone,5,This is the best iPhone I have ever owed and I have owned everyone of them except for the 8  I highly recommend on getting the iPhone X or as other people call it the iPhone 10,influenster
iphone,5,"I am so happy with this phone, I gave my daughter my 7 plus and the size difference was weird to me at first but I actually really love it! It’s fast, I love the memory space, and the overall quality of the phone is great. I’m definitely IPhone for life 😍",influenster
iphone,5,At first I didn’t think I was gonna like this phone but I was wrong!! The price is high but yeah!! I love everything about it!! It’s easy to use not complicated no issues at all!! I would recommend if your an Apple user and can afford it!! Get one!!,influenster
iphone,5,Love this phone! The photo quality is amazing! I got the 256GB so I could have more room (even though I don’t need it lol). Still trying to get use to the no home button but definitely love this phone!,influenster
iphone,5,"I want this new iPhone so badly! Not only is the facial recognition top of the line, I love the fact that it comes with a charging pad instead of a physical charger! And who isn’t excited about the talking emoji ability?!",influenster
iphone,5,This is my all time favorite product. I will never find anything that compares to it. I would be so grateful if I could get PR packages of this product so I could review for the people on my social media pages! It would get you more sales! I can’t stress enough how much I love this product!,influenster
iphone,5,People complain about it having no home button and just has face recognition instead of fingerprint but honestly it's really better than any of previous ones in my opinion. I like it.,influenster
iphone,5,"Best iPhone yet! I have had it for several months now and have nothing to complain about. Perfect size, tons of storage, super fast, amazing camera, and just COOL! I know it’s expensive but... it’s worth it.",influenster

iphone,5,My friend has this phone and it is amazing. It has very good camera quality. The best feature would probably be the animoji it is very fun to play with them,influenster
iphone,5,"I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. The phone is super fast, the screen is brilliant, and Apple offers a great 0% interest financing plan that includes Apple care. The camera is also amazing, I steal it from him all the time!  Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,By far my favorite iPhone! Getting used to the face detection to unlock sucks and first but once you get it you love it so much more than the thumb or the code!,influenster

iphone,5,I would like to say that I would love to have this phone so when you get into your phone you can get in your phone with your face. Yes it’s easy to use but you have to get a good case for it.yes it meet all of the requirements.yes others should buy the new phone.,influenster
iphone,4,"Just got my X for $400 off at Verizon on black Friday and I am over the moon about it.  The OLED screen really makes all the difference! I didn't think I would like Face ID, but it is convenient because it's so accurate - it can recognize me with and without makeup and glasses.  It's not that much bigger overall than a 6, which is what I switched from, but the screen is considerably larger.  This is a huge plus for me and I think it will be to other women with small hands!  I didn't want to get anything bigger because I have a feeling I would drop it all the time.  The camera is hands down the best feature on this phone.  Portrait mode works great, works well in low light, and makes pictures look professional.  I would get this while you can still get your hands on it at a discounted price, because it's already being discontinued by Apple in order for them to force you to pay for the XS in order to get the dual lens camera and OLED screen.  Would I pay $1000 for this? No way, but $500? Sure thing.",influenster
iphone,5,Best iPhone made!! I love that it’s easy to navigate. It’s sleek and a cute accessory for any fashionista.,influenster
iphone,5,I got this for my son for his birthday. He is very happy with it. He prefers apple over android products. I would recommend this.,influenster
iphone,5,"Amazing phone, once again an improvement on the last iPhone model that I had and was very happy with. The sound is much improved (louder & clearer speakers) and the face recognition is something that I don't know how  I will ever be able to live without in a phone now having had it- it's amazing. The camera is the big hit, it takes phenomenal photos with great editing options. The only downside is that as with all iPhones I've had, the screen is not too hard to crack so definitely invest in a good case and/or Sapphire glass or similar to cover it with. Note that this phone operates right to the very edges with regard to swiping actions and so forth so make sure that the protective case you choose allows for you to utilize that or it will be a bit frustrating at times. I have the Otterbox Pursuit & like it very much, the wrist strap comes in handy as well. Initially I had the Otterbox Defender which worked fine, but prefer the slimmer body, easier access to edges of screen and as mentioned, the wrist strap features of the Otterbox Pursuit. Back to the phone- an easy 5/5 stars! Apple iPhone X",influenster
iphone,5,I just got this phone as a Christmas gift and it is a GAME CHANGER!! It’s extremely easy to use. I thought the home button being gone would be problematic for me but it’s not at all! The facial recognition is great so I don’t have to type in my phone passcode every time. My favorite feature has gotta be the camera though. I’m obsessed with portrait mode for taking pictures of my little girl. With the combination of cool photo apps like Tintype or Vsco cam I can make great memories. 😍,influenster
iphone,4,"I bought this phone right when it was first released. it was very expensive, so I have been extremely careful to not crack my phone---as I would have to pay hefty consequences for doing so. I guess in my opinion, the photos have been great. I mainly use my phone for social media so it was important to me to make sure the product is fit for my necessities.",influenster

iphone,5,"I really do love this phone. I will admit, I do have a soft spot for apple, but I think apple blew it out of the park with this phone. The edge to edge display really makes the viewing experience amazing and Face ID is really accurate. One thing I do miss is the Touch ID, but if you had this phone for a while. You sorta forget that was even an option. The camera is amazing for photos and videos. It's very crisp and sometimes makes the picture even more beautiful than what it was in real life. I would definitely recommend this phone to everyone!",influenster
iphone,5,"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, yet one that really paid off six months into our testing. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.",influenster
iphone,5,"The iPhone X. Or the iPhone 10. The name is as confusing as the product itself is game-changing.  A new dawn for the iPhones has begun, free of the iconic Home key and the notorious screen bezels.The Face ID.

iphone,5,I think it’s worth the money. Great camera and great screen. Battery life isn’t amazing if you use your phone all the time but most phones are. There are older models which are also good if this is too pricey but I do recommend. Takes a while to get used to but it’s good.,influenster
iphone,5,"I was coming from an iPhone 6 Plus originally that just so happened to have screen damage the month I paid it off (typical) so instead of getting it repaired, I reverted back to my iPhone 5 (regular) and said I'd wait for the next release. Since the X was announced alongside the 8/8 Plus, I opted to wait even longer for the X and I'm glad I did. The look of the phone is top notch and the quality is definitely solid. Keep in mind I'm coming from something much older where the quality standards, while high at the time, pail in comparison to today's iPhone.I've had the iPhone X for six days now and don't even remember what using that Home button (that I've been using since the iPhone 3GS) is like. You'll forget it soon enough, too. The gestures are still very natural. I always hated how large the Plus model felt in my hands as doing anything ""one-handed"" was impossible, even using reachability. I feel that the X is a great balance between the non-Plus models and the Plus models and I did turn on reachability (it is turned off by default) to help reach some of the upper portions of the screen as I like using the phone one-handed.Next to my wife's iPhone 7 Plus, the screen size is virtually the same between the two, while the X's form factor is overall smaller, which is real nice. The ""notch"" along the top edge of the screen isn't an issue for me, as it seems to be for some. Within time, third-party apps will adopt the new resolution and everything will be seamless when switching applications. I have no qualms about the display's brightness either, as I find myself setting it to the lowest setting quite frequently. It's very bright! The only con I would give for the screen is that the refresh rate is lower than I expected, as I sometimes catch the screen flicker slightly with the naked eye as the oLED refreshes.I've never had Touch ID, so I cannot legitimately compare it to Face ID, but I can say that Face ID is very quick and intuitive. It was easy to setup and can be reset easily if desired. With Face ID, if there are notifications present and someone picks up your phone, they can only see what app is pushing the notification. The instance they hand the phone to you and you look at it, the specific notifications populate fully, which is nice if you're getting a text message that is for your eyes only. The only con (if you would call it that) I would give for Face ID is if your phone is sitting on a flat surface (such as a desk) and you're sitting next to it, your face is not within range of the sensor, so you have to either move into view/lift the phone into view, or enter the backup passcode to unlock the device.The speed is blazingly fast compared to my previous phones by far, while the battery life smashes any other iPhone I've had. I haven't charged it wirelessly so can't comment on that. I'll likely wait until Apple releases their own charging pad so I can use it with my Apple Watch. The sound output kinda blew me away too, as I've been finding myself turning it down, when I'm used to turning it up in the past. I don't care that they dropped the audio jack, as it's a wireless world we live in today. Thankfully for those of you who do require the audio jack, they include a Lightning to 3.5mm dongle adapter. As far as the camera, I was able to take amazing photos at a car show over the weekend, and the 4K video is stunningly crisp and smooth with it's dual stabilizing camera sensors. I'm in love with my phone again, and it's been awhile.The price I feel is fair in today's market. Yes, I paid $150 extra for the 256GB, but feel it's still very much worth the up-charge when the base only comes with 64GB. Photos, songs and videos add up quick, not to mention apps. The payment plan with your carrier makes it a little easier to swallow, and isn't much more than what my iPhone 6 Plus cost monthly back when it was new.I recommend Apple Care Protection, which can be purchased separately up to 60 days after original purchase date. Get a phone cover and screen protector on-the-double! Best Buy has many options available and I bought both a moderate, slimline cover and a durable, more bulky cover, as well as a glass screen protector. You'll want to protect this investment for sure.In short, if you've been holding out for three (or more) years like me, then this is definitely the iPhone you want to get. You will not be disappointed!",influenster
iphone,4,"It’s pretty good as iPhones go, not much different from older models the screen quality is very clear and good for watching videos, screen is big and easy to use and the Face ID is great and really works, the only thing I hate is the Apple Pay feature I much preferred the Touch ID function as it was so easy or using passcode but the double tap feature is pretty bad.",influenster
iphone,4,"I've had my iPhoneX for a few months now and honestly all the new features are amazing such as the face recognition, battery life, screen and camera, but there are some setbacks which i didn't expect, unlike other iphones in the past with this one in order to close an application you cant just swipe up like before you need to hold on the app and wait for an 'X' to show and then you close them one by one which is pretty frustrating, another setback is the lag it has. my phone suddenly just freezes and then turns off, and then i need to reopen the phone again. OH!! and last thing, the face recognition only recognizes you when you're sitting up straight so it needs a bit of an effort if you're just laying in bed, it's during these times where you start to miss your finger recognition.",influenster

iphone,5,"he iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got. The OLED display goes a long way in making amends for these quibbles. The 5.8-inch screen has a 2,436 x 1,125-pixel resolution (458 pixels per inch), and it’s razor sharp. Colors are vibrant, blacks are finally as pitch-dark as many other OLED Android phones, and it was easy to read in direct sunlight.  You’ll have a hard time pulling your eyes away from this screen. As on the iPhone 8 and iPad, Apple’s True Tone technology detects the lighting condition you’re in, and adjusts the screen’s tint to make it more readable. It works extremely well, and made the screen warmer — and easier on the eyes — in our harsh office lighting.The phone’s all-glass rear is almost the same as the iPhone 8 Plus, except the dual-camera setup has turned to a vertical orientation. Apple says the front-facing depth sensors and cameras took up a lot of space up top, and the rear camera wouldn’t fit sideways. With only the Apple and iPhone logo printed on the glass, the back looks minimal and sleek. The vertical orientation is a dead giveaway you have the iPhone X, as it’s a pretty unusual camera orientation and placement on a phone.One noticeable difference is the power button, which now perhaps should be called the “lock button.” Still situated on the right edge, it’s more elongated than before, which makes it easier to find and press. We say lock button because to turn off the iPhone X, you need to press the lock button and the volume up or down buttons. Tapping on the lock button just wakes or turns off your screen, but you can double tap it to activate Apple Pay, or press and hold it to launch Siri.The mute switch is on the top left, and the volume rocker sits below. There’s still no headphone jack, and the only port is for your Lightning cable at the bottom edge, between the bottom-firing speakers. For music, you’ll either have to pair wireless earbuds with the Bluetooth 5 technology on board, or you can embrace the dongle life with the included Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter.What I like most about the iPhone X is its size. It feels compact — it’s slightly larger than the 4.7-inch iPhone 8, but it has a bigger screen than the 5,5-inch iPhone 8 Plus. The X is comfortable in the hand, and it feels remarkable to have so much more screen real estate than a cumbersome “plus-sized” phone. Our Youtube Channel can be viewed at the following link.

iphone,5,"I’m so in love with this phone! All the little features such as FaceID, not showing a preview of a text unless it knows its you looking at the screen, not dimming when you are reading something and the sound quality is such a big difference alongside the brightness (I have mines just below half way now and it’s just as bright as my old iPhone when it was up full!). I also am a big lover of the True Tone setting, and don't get me started on the camera! It is so crisp and clean and takes wonderful photos, it’s like having my DSLR in my pocket! It only took me a day to get used to not having a home button and now when I’m on my iPod Touch (I use for music), I go to swipe up to open it as well!

iphone,5,"Apple deliberately saved its high-end features for the iPhone X and itâ€™s unlike anything itâ€™s released before.It has the largest screen of any iPhone, at 5.8in and it stretches from edge to edge like those seen on the Samsung Galaxy S8and Galaxy Note 8. This screen is Appleâ€™s first foray into OLED displays, too, and to fit the larger screen onto the device the home button has been ditched. Instead, thereâ€™s a 'notch' that houses the phoneâ€™s Face ID camera (more on which later). Youâ€™d imagine this might make the handset feel large, but by maximising screen size without increasing the size of the handset, the iPhone X feels smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus. In fact, itâ€™s closer in design and feel to the original iPhone than any of its recent predecessors.",influenster

iphone,4,"I havenâ€™t had an iPhone in forever, so when my previous phone, an android died out after a fatal fall, I decided to splurge on this. Iâ€™m happy and satisfied; however, I do feel there are better phones on market that cost much less. The camera MP itself is shit, but the way apple has set up the app and what you can do with the camera is superb. The battery lasts all day long and more. I do find it easier to game on androids and certain apps run smoother. However, if youâ€™re into only social media and selfies, this is an excellent phone. I love that the whole front is screen and the phone is made of glass. Colors are vivid on screen. It has many nice and useful features. It has a nice sleek look. Itâ€™s a good size for even my small hands to hold and take a selfie. If you tend to use earphones often, you may not like this phone as you can only connect the charger or the earphones at a time. I wish the buttons were all on one side only. The phone connects easily to car via Bluetooth. Iâ€™ve dropped this already and had no cracks on the phone, case, or glass screen protector.",influenster

I hated texting or typing on my iPhone 7 as the keyboard went right to the bottom of the phone and I found that my thumb knuckles would really start to hurt as I had to really torque my thumbs down the screen to type while holding my phone.

iphone,4,From An iPhone 7+ To iPhone X Thereâ€™s Not Much Of A Big Difference Other Than The Obvious Design Of The Phone And The Camera Quality. It Takes A Bit Of Getting Used To The Layout Isnâ€™t Much Different. However I Do Prefer The iPhone 7+/8+ If Your Clumsy I Wouldnâ€™t Recommend This Phone As It Is Glass And Deserves To Be Handled With Care. Other Than That The Phone Is Alright !

I have a channel on YouTube and a page on Instagram, I have a big family and Facebook friends like this product, Personally ,This is the product I loved most because its quality is very high and color is more than wonderful ,I hope to work for him review and will be wonderful All the respect and appreciation my email : ilyassc577@gmail.com",influenster
iphone,5,"I have had this phone for just less than a week now and I absolutely love it! It looks and feels amazing to use.It took a couple of days to get used to the lack of home button, but now it feels so much more natural to swipe up to close an app, and the new control centre looks great with the appearance of the phone.All of the new features are amazing. I am loving FaceID - it can also be used for things like internet banking, which is great. Also, the camera is amazing quality and selfies look great with the new portrait mode.The only thing I can fault is that the lack of the home button can make closing the apps fully a little bit more awkward than on previous models, however this is only because I would always fully close an app as soon as I was done with it.",influenster
iphone,5,Just like every other iPhone it is probably the best phone thatâ€™s out at the moment. Maybe not due to hardware but the user experience just keeps getting better. Thatâ€™s all that matters to me. I donâ€™t care about how much androids can do over iPhones because I do the same thing on any android that I would on and iPhone and the iPhone usually delivers a better experience and more fluidity.,influenster
iphone,5,"I was pretty excited to get the phone, but was also hesitant. I was going from a 6S to the X and was worried that it may be too much of a big change for me to get used to with it having no home button.After having the phone now for over a week, I am happy to say that I have been having a great experience with it so far. I had very little issues with switching to it. No problem at all with Face ID. The only thing I am not really a fan of is changing to app view and closing the apps out. I find it to be a bit of a time waster compared to how it was with a home button.One of my favourite features is the camera. I am really liking the quality of the photos, especially those that are taken in Portrait mode. I am very happy with this phone.",influenster
iphone,5,"Technology is something that all 21st century women love, thatâ€™s why this brand, especially #appel and its entire range of smart phones and accesories are always a good gift or Christmas gift because it is a very avant-garde quality product.

iphone,5,"The good The iPhone X delivers a great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous 5.8-inch OLED screen. The rear-facing telephoto camera outshoots the iPhone 8 Plus in low light, and the front-facing camera snaps impressive portrait mode selfies. Face ID generally works fine.The bad The iPhone X is nearly certain to be replaced by a newer, better model in less than 3 months, but remains hella expensive in the meantime. The all-glass body means a case and an insurance plan are musts. Shorter battery life than iPhone 8 Plus.",influenster

iphone,4,This is my first time ever owning an iPhone and I have found the transition from Android to IPhone has been easy. Iâ€™m in love with this phone especially the camera and recording capabilities and options. I have read about some issues with the phone and pray that I donâ€™t encounter them because the phone is a major financial investment. I have had it for two weeks now and it has frozen up on me which was scary and concerning but Iâ€™m not giving up on it yet. Hopefully that doesnâ€™t happen again because I love the phone!,influenster
iphone,5,"I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6 to the iPhone X. I absolutely love it! It took me a while to adjust to the home button and headphone jack being gone, but once I did, it was a breeze! The phone's processor is much faster, so it doesn't lag out. I LOVE how much better the camera quality is. The screen display is also much clearer with way better definition. And the battery life is a HUGE improvement... I only have to charge my phone every other day now instead of daily. The device itself is also very thin and lightweight. I have not used the face recognition feature yet, but I'm excited to try it out. So far I am very pleased with this phone, and I definitely would recommend it!",influenster
iphone,5,"Apple has been coasting for too long with the design it introduced for the iPhone 6, but that all changes with the iPhone X â€“ in a big way. You donâ€™t need me to tell you the iPhone X is a huge departure from the iPhone design of old â€“ just look at the pictures. Not only does it look good, however; Apple has done a fantastic job at actually making it feel really good too.",influenster

But for me, its important to have a good quality phone. Iphone doesnt have a many models as Samsung or any other brand , BUT! If anyone has even once used iphone im sure none of them will ever againg use any other phone. Nowadays the last model is Iphone X and for me, in this mobile is everything together.

On paper the 8 and X do not look that different but touch and feel wise there is a difference. The camera on the X is simply amazing with built-in optical image stabilization on both camera/focal lengths. The detail is crisp and sharp. This truly rivals a DLSR camera.

Phone freezes sometimes 4. Phone constantly logs me out of accounts even if I was just on it . 5. Headset that came with the phone broke after using it a few times.

It meet my expectations 100% and I would totally want to buy it for myself. The best feature is the The Face ID that is so safe and security wise. I would totally recommend this product. Oh! And the camera quality is TO DIE FOR.,influenster

Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got. The OLED display goes a long way in making amends for these quibbles. The 5.8-inch screen has a 2,436 x 1,125-pixel resolution (458 pixels per inch), and it’s razor sharp. Colors are vibrant, blacks are finally as pitch-dark as many other OLED Android phones, and it was easy to read in direct sunlight.  You’ll have a hard time pulling your eyes away from this screen. As on the iPhone 8 and iPad, Apple’s True Tone technology detects the lighting condition you’re in, and adjusts the screen’s tint to make it more readable. It works extremely well, and made the screen warmer — and easier on the eyes — in our harsh office lighting.The phone’s all-glass rear is almost the same as the iPhone 8 Plus, except the dual-camera setup has turned to a vertical orientation. Apple says the front-facing depth sensors and cameras took up a lot of space up top, and the rear camera wouldn’t fit sideways. With only the Apple and iPhone logo printed on the glass, the back looks minimal and sleek. The vertical orientation is a dead giveaway you have the iPhone X, as it’s a pretty unusual camera orientation and placement on a phone.One noticeable difference is the power button, which now perhaps should be called the “lock button.” Still situated on the right edge, it’s more elongated than before, which makes it easier to find and press. We say lock button because to turn off the iPhone X, you need to press the lock button and the volume up or down buttons. Tapping on the lock button just wakes or turns off your screen, but you can double tap it to activate Apple Pay, or press and hold it to launch Siri.The mute switch is on the top left, and the volume rocker sits below. There’s still no headphone jack, and the only port is for your Lightning cable at the bottom edge, between the bottom-firing speakers. For music, you’ll either have to pair wireless earbuds with the Bluetooth 5 technology on board, or you can embrace the dongle life with the included Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter.What I like most about the iPhone X is its size. It feels compact — it’s slightly larger than the 4.7-inch iPhone 8, but it has a bigger screen than the 5,5-inch iPhone 8 Plus. The X is comfortable in the hand, and it feels remarkable to have so much more screen real estate than a cumbersome “plus-sized” phone.",influenster

iphone,5,"""What i love about the Iphone X is that it's not only suitable for normal day usage.

With unlimited photos and videos of families, friends and places.My #GiftCrush that I'm hoping to get is the Iphone X. As you noticed that there a tonnes of a poaitive review about the latest Iphone. What with the Face Unlock System and others. But impacted me more to choose this phone is that, the quality of the camera. The images that its capture and the details of it. I love travelling. But what i hate the most is the bulky gadget that i need to bring along. Sometimes i spent half of my luggage for my camera stuff. The tripod, battery, the lense and even the camera itself is bigger than others. With this brand new iphone. Not only I bring along 1 items for all. It saves me a space on my luggage. It hassle free, no more hit someone else accidentally when bringing my big bulky tripod. I just bring my phone stand. And tadaaa. As simple as ABC.I want this Iphone so badly that I try surveyed it in my country. Unfortunately the price is a bit higher that i expected for a medium salary person like me.

iphone,5,"The iphone x launch was an incredibly risky one but Apple somehow made it successful. We all needed a change from the same boring looking gadgets and iphone x was just the right choice. Although expensive the latest iphone offers face id which enables animoji which is short for animated emoji, a fster processor and a better camera for all the techies out there. My experience with iphone x is kind of a mixed reaction where on one hand i love the features but on the other i hate taking my phone out in public in fear of flexing. The face id is kind of a fail cause my sister is sometimes able to open my phone even without knowing the passcode and the no earphones jack thing is annoying which brings me to my next point. The x has passed the drop test successfully without the glass body shattering entirely and the water test where it was submerged 20 ft down a river and still survived. Despite apple saying it can only survive 1m, it surpassed our expectations and went 6.67 m which is incredible. This technology gives us hope that in the future we can get our flying cars which we were promised a decade ago and that humanity is definitely evolving not reversing as whole.",influenster

iphone,5,"I’m so in love with this phone! All the little features such as FaceID, not showing a preview of a text unless it knows its you looking at the screen, not dimming when you are reading something and the sound quality is such a big difference alongside the brightness (I have mines just below half way now and it’s just as bright as my old iPhone when it was up full!). I also am a big lover of the True Tone setting, and don't get me started on the camera! It is so crisp and clean and takes wonderful photos, it’s like having my DSLR in my pocket! It only took me a day to get used to not having a home button and now when I’m on my iPod Touch (I use for music), I go to swipe up to open it as well! Also really love the control centre and how you can customise what controls you want displayed there. It really is Apples best phone yet!",influenster

iphone,4,"I bought this phone after my brand new 8 plus was stolen. I was not a fan at first which is why I did not choose it over my 8+ but the smaller size did grow on me. The lack of home button and face recognition took a bit to get used to but comes in handy especially when you're cooking and can't wipe your hands right away to unlock your phone. The screen delivers crisp and clear video quality that is like a dream. I use my phone a lot for drone flying and quick videos when I'm traveling without needing to carry a DSLR or other heavy equipment for about the same quality. Would not choose the XS over the X but if you're upgrading from below an 8, then the XS could be the phone for you.",influenster

But I would say that if it is worth paying because the phone has new features such as facial unlocking, emojis, the camera is super good and the design is super cute to the only thing that I do not get used to is that it does not have the button if not that it is with the finger all",influenster

It may not recognise you if you wrap in scarf and hat, but generally it does a good job!

There were close to 300 people waiting and the store would only let a few of us in at a time.The BIGGEST thing I noticed was 3 customers while I was there asking if they could change from the Space Grey to the Silver because it looked so much better.

The camera takes out really great pics, both front and back. The graphics is amazing. The overall finishing a on the iPhone X is really crisp and elegant.",influenster
iphone,5,"Apple has been coasting for too long with the design it introduced for the iPhone 6, but that all changes with the iPhone X – in a big way. You don’t need me to tell you the iPhone X is a huge departure from the iPhone design of old – just look at the pictures. Not only does it look good, however; Apple has done a fantastic job at actually making it feel really good too.  This phone is simply gorgeous. It’s slightly taller than the iphone 8 and 7 and 6 but much narrower and smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus. It strikes the perfect balance, especially since you’re getting a 5.8-inch display .The aluminium sides have been swapped out for stainless steel – as seen on the Apple Watch – and the front and rear of the device are glass. I received the Silver variant for review – and, unfortunately, it wasn’t long before it was covered in fingerprints, those shiny sides being a particular magnet. This is a phone that looks fantastic straight after a wipe-down; not so much a few hours after it’s been in your greasy palms.Also of concern is how the iPhone X will fare over time. No matter how unscientific they might be, drop tests indicate that the finish here doesn’t lend itself well to wear and tear. After all, the stainless steel Apple Watch I’ve been using is a scratched-up mess. As a result, my iPhone X has spent much of its time inside an Apple case, but this certainly sees it lose points in the glamour stakes.iPhone X 64GB – 15GB, £42pm, £250 upfront on O2 (use code TRUSTED10 to save £10)Alternatively,",influenster

iphone,5,"The good The iPhone X delivers a great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous 5.8-inch OLED screen. The rear-facing telephoto camera outshoots the iPhone 8 Plus in low light, and the front-facing camera snaps impressive portrait mode selfies. Face ID generally works fine.The bad The iPhone X is nearly certain to be replaced by a newer, better model in less than 3 months, but remains hella expensive in the meantime. The all-glass body means a case and an insurance plan are musts. Shorter battery life than iPhone 8 Plus.",influenster

iphone,5,"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.it is a perfect phone buy it",influenster

iphone,5,"What i love about the Iphone X is that it's not only suitable for normal day usage. But it also great for traveling. The functions are so detailed that you doesn't need to bring other heavy gadget along while traveling.  This is where i want to keep my most precious memories. With unlimited photos and videos of families, friends and places.My #GiftCrush that I'm hoping to get is the Iphone X. As you noticed that there a tonnes of a poaitive review about the latest Iphone. What with the Face Unlock System and others. But impacted me more to choose this phone is that, the quality of the camera. The images that its capture and the details of it. I love travelling. But what i hate the most is the bulky gadget that i need to bring along. Sometimes i spent half of my luggage for my camera stuff. The tripod, battery, the lense and even the camera itself is bigger than others. With this brand new iphone. Not only I bring along 1 items for all. It saves me a space on my luggage. It hassle free, no more hit someone else accidentally when bringing my big bulky tripod. I just bring my phone stand. And tadaaa. As simple as ABC.I want this Iphone so badly that I try surveyed it in my country. Unfortunately the price is a bit higher that i expected for a medium salary person like me. If only i can get this as a gift. It will make my whole years feel like dancing in the rain. ELATEDLY HAPPY",influenster

iphone,5,"I had the first iPhone that was out years ago and I loved it. Thought I’d see what all of the android phones were like before getting another. Must admit, I still can’t fault them. They have to be the best phone out there as gadget wise. It’s improved a hell of a lot over time and it keeps me occupied all day long with the great apps that the App Store provides and all of the music too. Sound quality with out headset is fab!!! I hardly ever now use my Bluetooth speakers because the sound is so good. What I love about the features now, are the touch senses when you unlock your phone, it’s fab!!! Camera is great!!! Overall, iPhone is a winner for me, beats the others I’ve had in the past",influenster
iphone,4,"El famoso iPhone X un dispositivo revolucionario, en el que Apple a dado un gran salto pero, todo no es color de rosa, este dispositivo aun no esta optimizado, lo cual las apps de terceros aun no estan adaptadas a su pantalla y hacen un uso dificil, pero es un dispositivo muy potente, con el famoso Chip A11 bionic y una gran camara trasera y delantera con modo retrato en las dos, el famoso Animoji y su mantalla Super Retina.",influenster
iphone,4,"I’ve had the new iPhone X for around a month now and overall I’m pleased. The expectations surrounding this phone were extremely high so I was excited to finally get my hands on it. I love the new layout of the phone and the high quality of the camera. I love the Face ID - it works every time! I upgraded from a 6s therefore I have benefitted greatly from the iPhone X. However, I do wonder whether this phone is actually worth £1,000. I personally feel the price is too high. Furthermore, I was greatly disappointed that when watching YouTube videos the full screen does not get used - it gets cut to resemble an old iPhone screen. Nevertheless, overall I’m very happy with the iPhone X and have had no problems upon use.",influenster

iphone,5,"I know that I’m not the only one that likes apple products, but I know that I love them just as much as they do. I have the iPhone 7 right now and I love it so much. I have been an Apple fan ever since I got the iPod touch 4th generation. I’ve had the IPod touch, IPad mini 4, Mac Book Air, and IPhone SE before the iPhone 7. I’m the types of person that loves taking pictures. Every time I’m at my cottage I’m always taking pictures of the lake. I love the camera on this phone, it’s so clear. The size of the phone is nice but it’s a little too small for my hands. I’m was little upset that it doesn’t have the headphone jack but that didn’t stop me from buying it.  I have had this phone since August 13th 2017 (My Birthday) and won’t get a new phone till 2019. When my contract is up, I will be getting the newest phone that will come out. I used to have a Samsung Galaxy S5 before my SE and it was horrible, mine and my sisters kept crashing so we decided to go to Apple instead of Samsung",influenster
iphone,5,I was really happy with my Iphone X. I had an Iphone 6 before and 16 GB was not enough for my photos apps and videos now I have 64GB storage which is enough for me. The quality of the photos and videos are superb. It just take a little bit to figure how you can take a sreen shot and how to turn on and off your iphone X because it doesn’t have a home button. But overall I give it a 5!! :),influenster
iphone,5,"My dad has this phone and I honestly would love to have one myself.1. You get two colours black and silver so beautiful.2. Face idea, I find this very handy so it’s hard for people to get on your phone.3. No home screen button which you can have more space on your phone! 4. The storage is amazing! So if I had the chance to get this product I’d definitely buy it, would you?",influenster
iphone,5,"omg ! what should i say ? oh god ! iphone x  it's amazing !! .. i hope that i could have it   I’m so in love with this phone! All the little features such as FaceID, not showing a preview of a text unless it knows its you looking at the screen, not dimming when you are reading something and the sound quality is such a big difference alongside the brightness (I have mines just below half way now and it’s just as bright as my old iPhone when it was up full!). I also am a big lover of the True Tone setting, and don't get me started on the camera",influenster
iphone,5,"Just got myself an upgrade from an iPhone 4! Loving the phone so far! Love the new features of the camera! “portrait stage light mono” fun to use and the shots come out professional looking. Animoji is super fun to use when texting with family & friends.

iphone,4,Hola . Lo único malo que tengo que decir de este maravilloso smartphone es su precio. En mi país (Perú) está como 3000 o 4000 soles. Que es aproximadamente 4 -6 meses trabajando duro con un salario mínimo .,influenster
iphone,5,The iPhone X has always been like a dream because of its crazy design and features. The camera is also the biggest attraction for us girls who love taking selfies and photos! I really hope to own it someday....,influenster
iphone,4,This phone is really modern and the graphics are amazing but it is really expensive. The amazing screen makes watching videos a lot better but it doesn’t have a button which makes it a lot harder to use.,influenster
iphone,4,this is a good phone. comes with 3d face detection and animojis.it also have some great ar quality but it is not as per the rate. it costs 1000$ to buy this thing which is a little more.,influenster
iphone,5,"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.",influenster
iphone,5,"I want to try this, I want an iPhone, I'm needing this now, iPhone is a good mark of cellphones, I have iPhone 6 normal..... but I want try the iPhone X, this cellphone is so amazing I like so much the camera my best friends have one and is so phenomenal.",influenster
iphone,5,"I love this phone! Apple phones are known for being user friendly, which is why I love them. I’m not the most tech savvy, so the one Android phone I did own wasn’t my favorite. I wasn’t used to the layout of that phone, and I think the iPhone has a very user friendly layout. My grandparents also have this iPhone and it is working well for them. I’ve had this phone for about a year and a half and is still working well for me. Love it! thanks",influenster

Amo esta marca ❤",influenster
iphone,5,"I love iphone . I upgraded from an S4. The camera and screen quality is amazing and the charging is really fast. It was expensive, but we were able to get a buy one/get one free and the only way cell phone carriers operate these days is to finance it over 2 years if you don't want to buy it outright, so the monthly payment for the 2 phones we got is affordable. I would highly recommend this phone. I am a Mac person for just about every other electronic I own, but I switched to Samsung/Android a little over 2 years ago and like them so much more than my iPhone. Every time I was upgrading my iPhone (I went through 3 models, loved my first) they seemed to have more and more glitches and it was very frustrating. I have not looked back since I switched! I was concerned with the Edge and potentially hitting it on accident, but I have not had that problem",influenster

iphone,5,"Well, where should I start. First of all this phone is so slimm and it is very comfortable to hold in your hand. The camera is absolutely stunning and the mechanism of the devise is just amazing. I just have to say that the price of this device might be a bit too high, so not everyone can afford this phone!",influenster
iphone,5,I got the iPhone XR red right before Christmas and Iâ€™m pretty happy with it.  All iPhones basically all the same with a couple different perks. Iâ€™m happy with it tho. Rather know what im doing then confused with a different phone,influenster
iphone,5,"i am passionate about the iPhone x,and even more for taking pictures of landscapes,i would cry a lot if i won an iphone,i would love to take Pictures with him anywhere",influenster
iphone,5,"I'd been waiting for the iPhone X for 2 years. My review follows this rant.2 years ago rumours started to circulate about this upcoming edge-to-edge fully glassed piece of art, which would be released on the iPhone's 10th anniversary. It would encompass the fastest processor, a 4k camera, 4k AMOLED screen, reality augmentation, new speakers, Face ID, In-screen Touch ID, and proximity wireless charging (a charging station that transmits a charge without contact).If the rumours held true this device would be the king of all Smart phones, no question.",influenster

iphone,5,Stick with Apple as it’s so easy to navigate. iPhone X although behind Samsung still delivers,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,I bought this phone a few weeks back and I'm really pleased with it. Face ID is a new feature that works well and there are some new gestures that are easy to master. The battery lasts all day even after heavy use.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Upgraded from my iPhone 6S. Features are considerably better as you would expect. Display is gorgeous and sound quality excellent due to the 2 built in stereo speakers. Only took me an hour to get used to not having the home button. I actually prefer the Face ID over the finger print scanner is it works quicker. There are a few additional features which I didn’t have on the iPhone 6S, such as Apple spreadsheets, word and PowerPoint specifically designed for phones which some people might find useful. Great price and interest free over a year. The only downside is you have to pay extra for a fast 12W charger as only the basic 5W charger is supplied.",Very.co.uk
iphone,4,"Updated my handset, great new features and super easy to set up and get going right out of the box",Very.co.uk

iphone,5,Great phone! Now even better value with reduced prices. Didn’t agree with Apple pricing their phones for £999 so waited it out. Glad now that I did.

iphone,5,"Bought as an upgrade to iPhone 6. Very impressed with this version, OLED screen is sublime and love the Face ID, much prefer to the home button. Haven’t tried camera yet but guess it will be pretty good. Great phone for a decent price now it’s dropped £220. Like the fact screen is bigger than my last iPhone but handset overall isn’t much bigger.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Love all features would never go past an IPhone for music photos memory,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Bought last week very happy good staff !!!!!!!!!!!,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,On Black Friday my Daughter changed her mind about an Apple Watch as her main gift and as her phone was broken asked for the Apple IPhone X. After I nearly fell off the chair at the price difference between watch and phone I ordered it from Very because of the price drop. We have already exchanged gifts as I won't see my Daughter again this year. She has fed back how amazing the phone is and is very grateful for her gift.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"I was going to buy an XR, but father X came up as a good deal with Very. So, what with it being slightly smaller, nicer screen and better camera, I couldn’t resist, really glad I didn’t too!",Very.co.uk

iphone,5,This phone is a great upgrade from my iPhone 7 the battery lasts really well and the camera is really good,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Best apple I phone. Absolutely love this purchase!,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,I’ve just upgraded from a iPhone 5s and the speed of this phone is immense. The only thing I’m struggling with at the minute is the sheer size of the screen and holding it in one hand. I’m sure I will get used to this in time. Otherwise this phone is absolutely fantastic.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,I bought this with £200 off and £120 cash back on my account. Screen is unbeatable and phone overall is fab !!,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,So glad I got this phone. Very good phone. Easy to use,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Purchased to replace an iPhone 6S and a far superior phone. Yes, the phone is newer and a lot more expensive but so much quicker. The battery is a major improvement and that's with having the battery in the iPhone 6S only replaced 8 months ago. Quicker processor and larger screen but still the battery in the X lasts a lot more longer.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,I came across the above phone on hotukdeals. Having an old 6s plus I knew the time was right to upgrade and I don’t regret it. The phone is a amazing and much better than it’s predecessors,Very.co.uk
iphone,4,"I got this phone a week ago and so far and very pleased with it, it does have some new features but to be honest I’m not seeing massive differences from the iphone6 I upgraded from. Is working a lot quicker but then again it is brand new.",Very.co.uk

iphone,5,I brought this for my son it’s amazing and he loves it,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Really please with a good deal on just what I was looking for the iPhone X Met all expectations and more,Very.co.uk
iphone,4,The iphone X is still better than the new Iphone XR in terms of features especially as it has the dual cameras compared to the single camera. Although the XR chip is the latest model I feel chips don't really improve the phone unless theres a gap of 2 between the latest chip. The dual sims is a good incentive but it's not really relevant unless you have a work sim.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,I bought the iPhone X last weekend and it was delivered by Wednesday. I’ve always loved apple products and this phone is brilliant with all of its great features. The camera is also amazingly out of this world. I could not reccomend this iPhone enough. Fantastic. Amazing. Brilliant. Definitely worth the buy :),Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Brought this as a gift which was well received! Might not be the XS iphone but this is comparable in specs at a much reduced price. Would recommend all to consider this over the XS due to price.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,I bought this week ago and amzaing phone very bright and easy to use.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"I bought iPhone X around week ago and I really love it, very good quality of phone, beautiful pictures and many more also I have to add it was good price whit prom code, I’m very happy",Very.co.uk

iphone,5,Very happy with product and extremely quick light weight and everything you need for daily use,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Just upgraded from a 6s amd this IMO is leaps and bounds ahead of it. Siri seems to work better face recognition flawless and so much easier than the finger print recog. Probably wouldn’t have upgraded however if the price hadn’t dropped I’m a recent promotion. Otherwise delighted with purchase,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Excellent features. Graphics are awesome with an excellent camera quality,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,I brought this some time ago and it has every thing you want in a mobile phone the best thing is the quality of the photo Crystal clear I would recommend this phone to every one,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Bought this from very at a discounted price but boy I wish I waited a week as cash back was applied and I could of saved even more. This phone is excellent I recommend if you’re thinking of getting it, get it now as this will be the beat deal for a brand new iphone x",Very.co.uk

iphone,5,"Really good, easy to use, didn’t come as quick with delivery but love the product",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Purchased this phone last week after reading reviews. Phone is brilliant very quick and clear. After some research Very was cheapest buying out right which will save me at least couple of hundred pound in the long run. Fast delivery. Do it you will not be disappointed!,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Bought a couple of weeks ago. Fantastic phone so far. Bought this instead of the iPhone XS as the specs are nearly identical. Really can’t tell the difference between the A11 chip and the A12 chip.,Very.co.uk

iphone,5,"Great phone, great price, can't get better than paying off over 1 year interest free....",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"After being on Android for a little while now and coming back to iPhone I can honestly say even though the price isn’t justified there’s a lot of things I honestly love about iPhones, how simple it is to navigate and how easy texting is, I always love the small things on the phone like when your listening to music it doesn’t cap the volume and ruin it. love this phone",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"I bought the phone for my wife who has never had an iPhone before but fortunately knows how to use the iPad, this helps because the iOS is very similar.",Very.co.uk
iphone,4,"Bought this as an upgrade to My pixel 2. The phone on the whole is all you could ever want. The screen is incredible and without fault. However, the camera does fall a bit short of the Pixel 2 but is still Very good. All in all, the iPhone X is a great all rounder.",Very.co.uk
iphone,4,"Good phone, at a good price now the iphobe XS is out. Little difference between the phones. I did not receive notification that it had been dispatched however it did arrive when expected. A little cheeky to charge deliver on such a high price item but otherwise content with Very.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Had every iPhone since the iPhone 4 and this is by far the best, great phone",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"I’ve always had iPhones but this one has been the best so far! Great features, good size phone and the picture/screen quality is brilliant. The price was good too, the cheapest price I found.",Very.co.uk

iphone,5,"I’ve had the iPhone X for 6 months now. After being a Samsung customer for the past 8 years I was a bit worried about switching but I needn’t have. The phone is great, well built. The faceID works perfectly as does the camera which was some really clever features. Don’t hesitate to hit this!",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,I would say this is probably the best iphone Apple has launched till now.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"I bought this phone last week, set it up this morning and love it, so easy to us.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Purchased this phone two weeks ago my previous phone was the Apple iPhone 8 Plus I didn’t expect this phone to be that much better... boy I was wrong. It’s awesome!!!

iphone,5,"I bought this phone over a week ago, really impressed and love the animojis.",Very.co.uk
iphone,4,"I bought this just over a week ago. Being more android savvy it took me a couple of days to get used to the iOS way of doing things but it comes pretty easy once you start using it. Have to say the camera is by far apples best to date, the apps open quickly and so far run smoothly. If your into apple phones, the iPhone X is a must. If your more android, give the X some serious thought it’s by far apples best.",Very.co.uk

iphone,5,"Excellent iPhone, upgraded from the iPhone 8. It’s easy to use and the facial recognition works brilliantly.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Having owned all iPhones over the years & enjoyed something in all of them, in my opinion this exceeds expectations & is the best all rounder yet. Switched from iPhone 7 plus - wanted a more compact phone with similar screen size. The new OLED screen is absolutely superb, bionic operating system is lightning fast & as always with Apple - everything just works. New features are excellent, build quality is reassuringly solid & expensive (invest in a case though - the back is made of glass) overall if you are in the market with this sort of budget go for it, you won't look back. Buying outright also saves a little on most contract rates over 24 mk this & gives you the option of using any network. Delivered next day - thanks littlewoods- I'm loving this..!",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"About of phone everyone knows is a great phone,about verry fast delivery and very professional retailer",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Amazing phone, excellent features. Prompt delivery",Very.co.uk
iphone,2,Bought this a week ago and im very disappointed. Phone freezes opening apps and isnt much of an upgrade from the iphone 7 which is 2 phones ago. Facial recognition is handy but not worth the extra money.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,I got this phone for my few months ago absolutely wicked love it no problems at all,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,I'd been putting off purchasing this phone for so long now due to the high price tag but with very giving me a 10% discount as a new customer thought I'm gloing to try it.All i can say is WOW this is definately the best iphone apple have ever made.I was concerned how i would find the phone as it doesn't have a home button but with the facial recognition and a swipe up or down it is surprisingly easy to get used to and after 5 minutes it's second nature.All I can recommend is if you purchase this phone is to also purchase a tech 21 case and screen protector as this will protect it from damage.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Had been thinking of upgrading from my iPhone 6 for a while.. So glad I waited a while from the X’s first release as I got it on offer and with cashback on buy now pay in 12 months so got a triple bargain and not tied into a long contract with a mobile provider. So easy to set up & connect my new Cellular Apple Watch (I got the same deal on this also so top marks to Very). Can’t believe just how good the camera is and the animoji’s make Everyone smile. You will not be disappointed!!,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Loved it totally! Switched from galaxy note 8 and really glad I did it.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Had this phone for a week now, and it really is a thing of beauty. Brilliant screen and looks amazing. It does everything very quickly. Music plays louder than previous iPhones. Camera is the best I have ever used on a phone. Links up to my iMac as you would expect without issue. The only thing about this phone that's bad, is the price. If you can afford it, then simply, just buy it. It's the best phone I have ever had.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Expensive but worth it. Delivery was fast and it looks good and feels good!,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,I had been thinking about purchasing this for a while but when I noticed the price was less than apples. I guess it was worth the splurge. The only problem I had was the delivery. I requested to have it delivered to my local post office so I could collect it at my own convenience. However I never got a notification to say it has been delivered. Instead at 5pm I got a message to say it was out for delivery and when I checked the tracking it said it had been signed for that morning at 11am. I went down to the post office asap but due to it being past 5 on the Friday they said I would have to come back on Tuesday as this was the next working day due to the bank holiday. I was working on the Tuesday and gave my ID to someone to collect it for me but they advised I had to come in person due to the price of the item. So I didn’t even get the phone until the Wednesday! overall it was worth the wait. Battery life is amazing! I went from a standard iPhone and the transition of the size of the phone is fine. You get used to having a bigger phone. Takes time getting used to not having a home button but the Face ID is really responsive. The only problem I’ve noticed is it doesn’t work when you’re lying down on your side as it needs to recognise your full face.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Bought this for my daughters birthday and she is so happy.,Very.co.uk
iphone,3,I bought this iphone i week ago but not so good but okey,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Top class phone! As with all iPhones, the class leader!",Very.co.uk

iphone,5,Its a good phone without any doubt. Its features and specially camera is taking mind blowing pictures. I really loved it.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Obviously looks very similar to the 7 size wise ( add an inch to height ) but as it uses the whole screen it just feels so different, used Face ID for paying on Apple Pay and it’s so clever, no issues with refinishing my face at any angle ,the phone operates very quick and is very loud , certainly the best Apple phone ( I’ve had them all ) too pricey for what it is tho but that’s apples fault not littlewoods lol",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Very happy with my new iPhone X well worth the money,Very.co.uk

iphone,3,I bought this phone as I wanted Face ID and Animoji witch is good but it’s not really a lot different to any other iPhone tbh I wouldn’t say it’s worth the money you pay for it but I do like it simply because it has the features I was wanting,Very.co.uk

iphone,5,very good deal with £100 cashback and enabled me to go sim only for 12mths at a far lower costs and without being bound for 2 years on airtime contract.

iphone,2,"Great phone, but I’m so disappointed with the quality control! I opened it to find scratches on the screen, but since it’s been opened it’s now unreturnable. For the price, I’d expect more and I’m really annoyed that the item is now devalued through no fault of my own.",Very.co.uk

iphone,4,"I bought this phone about a week ago, i’ve been buying iphones since the 3gs. I like the edge to edge screen, the glass back adds to the look, but i did worry that i’d break that and it’s meant to be expensive to fix so also got protective case straight away (i have children) I love the animoji feature and the facial recognition unlock. it’s a lovely phone, fairly different to the 7 and i really like it.",Very.co.uk
iphone,4,"Had the phone a few weeks now. Takes a while to get used to the new gestures and no thumb scanner. Face ID works fine though and the screen size is ideal. I found the 8 plus too big and the standard 8 too small. Battery life is great, lasts a full day without charging. I wouldn't say its worth the price though as the 8 plus works just as well.",Very.co.uk
iphone,4,"The phone itself is a great piece of tech, may take some getting used to the new way the ‘home’ function works and Face ID works 95% of the time. Still lacks app support, as a lot of apps do not take advantage of the full screen - youtube being one of them. All in all - very happy with the purchase, although it is seriously overpriced, for what it is.",Very.co.uk

It's lightning fast, FaceID works perfectly and very cleverly (won't unlock if you don't look at the phone) and the new gestures are easy to master. The migration from my old iPhone to the new one was fast and seamless. Over all a great piece of kit and I strongly recommend it one the iPhone 8.",Very.co.uk

It is slick, fast running and has an unreal camera! I have nothing bad to say about it, only thing I would advise though is to invest in a decent phone cover as it is fully glass front and back so if you were to drop it then it would be an expensive mistake to make!

I love the camera, Face ID for all the apps and webpages instead of putting in my passwords. The only thing I needed to get used to was the no home button but I have having all this screen space. I had to google how to screen shot but that’s it. Me and my children had a great laugh with you become the emoji. All in all if you are an apple lover like me then this is the phone for you.

iphone,5,"I got this phone not too long ago and it was an amazing upgrade from my iPhone 6S Plus. I was contemplating going for the iPhone 8 Plus but I decided that I would just take a leap and get the X. It was a great purchase. Got the phone the next day of ordering it. Setting the phone up was a BREEZE. As anyone who has upgraded from and iPhone to a new iPhone, you simply backup your content and download it back, it's as easy as that. The phone is very fast and the new gestures on the X to compensate for no home button on the home are great.I would definitely recommend getting a case and screen protector, even if you do have insurance on it as the phone will most likely damage easier than previous iterations. The face id takes a while to get used to from using the finger print scanner as you'll try to unlock the phone by using your thumb quite a bit, but in time it'll stop. Face ID is amazing and for me personally is more consistent than the finger print scanner, especially if you're out and about and sometimes the scanner doesn't read your finger. The camera is amazing and as someone who doesn't use cameras much, this surprised me so much. All in all, if you have an old iPhone and are looking for an upgrade, I would recommend the X and same goes for anyone moving over from the Android family.",Very.co.uk

The screen is amazing and the photos have come out really well. If your looking for a luxury item then this is for you. You can wait till the next generation, but I suspect to make it cheaper they may not use similar items which imo would make it inferior.",Very.co.uk

The face recognition is good...when it works, but, having to use a 6 digit pin when it doesn't is a pain...it mainly doesn't work in darker light (touch and go). I had the iPhone 6 and decided to upgrade as the screen was going, but, for the money I can't say that this was the best investment. I wish I'd saved a few pounds and opted for the 8 instead.

iphone,5,A fantastic piece of equipment . Would recommend to all.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Bought the iPhone X as an upgrade to my iPhone 7 Plus. The phone is really responsive and it didn't take long to discover how to use the slightly different interface. It's rather nice having a smaller size mobile with a bigger and sharper display - it's easier to hold. This is a very expensive device but it is excellent and super-fast with a brilliant screen.,Very.co.uk

iphone,5,Buy last week very happy with that beautiful and fast machine.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"In the end I caved I got one a couple of months after launch. I delayed because of all the bad press saying it’s not much different than the 8 or 7 for that matter. But when I checked one out in person I decided to go for it. I’m well impressed with it. Face ID works amazingly well, it’s so handy to glance at the phone and notifications unravel. My secure apps that all worked with Touch ID now work with Face ID. again, it just works. The screen size is excellent, ok, Android users have enjoyed this for a lot less cash. But I’m a fan of iOS, I’d rather not have to ‘manage’ my OS. The short cut features do take some re-training, but they make complete sense and after a day or two come naturally. I’m very happy with the X. Definitely the future of iPhone.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"I have had every iPhone since Apple first started bringing them out, Oh! my word this is the best lot's of different features and great fun so easy to use, much better with no home button, camera WOW! you have to try for yourself you are not going be disappointed trust me 10/10",Very.co.uk

iphone,5,Had the phone just over 1 week and I love it it’s so simple to use but I am a huge apple/iOS fan,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Justifying the cost will be down to the individual and the only pain point. However, it truly delivers on taking iOS and iPhone forward. If IOS is your OS of choice, it won't leave you disappointed or wanting. It is a joy to use and quality assured. Totally intuitive. Using my old iPhone already feels clunky in comparrison.",Very.co.uk

iphone,4,I’ve treated myself to the iPhone X great phone user friendly and the missing home button isn’t missed.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,An early present. Can view from every angle. Expensive. You get what you expect from Apple,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"It’s expensive and it is essentially “just a iPhone”, but it’s worth it. Everything about it feels premium, from the screen, build quality, camera and Face ID which works great. Is it worth the price? As someone who uses their phone heavily daily, it’s worth it. Only negative is some of the apps don’t use the full screen, and battery life isn’t quite as good as my old iPhone 7 Plus.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"So the iPhone X has finally arrived.. what can i say? Its the best iPhone yet. Although it is expensive the fact that its an iphone 10 you are well ahead of the game. The screen is clear and sharp and you can tell the differenc in quality compared to the other iphone models. I was suggest anyone thinking of buying the iphone x to invest in Apple Care, Insurance and a case as you dont want to damage this due to its price tag! Anyone who hasnt used an iPhone should note that this phone takes a Nano sim which is a lot smaller than the regular micro sim.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Great phone Apple what more can you say Great service from very as usual service don’t add any thing extra to the price like some other sites choice of payment options are fantastic all round happy happy happy,Very.co.uk

iphone,5,So happy with my new iPhone X definitely worth the short wait.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"I've had a number of iphone models over the years (starting back at the 3GS) and am always excited to upgrade, but I've never been so pleased with the result. I've upgraded from the iPhone 6 and there is an impressive array of new features. The camera is a huge draw and the quality is incredible but the animojis and AR are also fun features which I didnt realise I would have so much fun with! The phone itself looks incredible, the glass back is stunning, although I have put a projector on both the front and the back just to be on the safe side. This was my first purchase from Very and I was very impressed, the phone arrived a week before my expected delivery date and arrived within 18 hours of recieving the dispatch notification!",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Really good display and excellant battery life the only downside is the cost,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Great phone and once again Apple havent let their customers down. Very different from any other iPhones, it took me a while to get used to a home button not being there, however, now I don’t miss it. Battery life seems to be pretty good too. So far so good :)",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Lets get it out of the way, it costs a grand. To a lot of people, and quite rightly so, its way too much money. But if you are in the very lucky position of being able to afford it, then it is the best iphone Apple have ever made. The screen is unmatched, the user experience still the best of the bunch, the camera superb & Apple still have the best app & media services out of any platform. Simply put it is the best smartphone out there & everyone else is playing catch up for another year.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,speedy delivery as always fromVery. Had a few iPhones and this is the best one !. I bought a case to protect it as it’s all glass and a little slippery in your hands. The face unlock is very fast too.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,I bought this on pre-order as a replacement for my iPhone 6. The service from Very was fantastic and it arrived at 8:30am on release day... weeks before my friends/family who ordered direct from Apple received theirs. Thanks for the fantastic service Very!,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Pre-ordered for it to be delivered on release day. I wasn’t disappointed. In my opinion it’s the bet iPhone yet. The wireless charging works really well, the Super Retina screen is brilliantly clear and bright. But, so far, the battery has been better than I’d read. I get a whole day and more out of it and I’m a reasonably user.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Received on release day was amazing the phone itself is beautiful glass back glows like nothing else almost pearlescent looking looks very high end and is delightful to touch doesn’t feel as slippy as previous phones with metal finish. Definitely a lot heavier that previous phones probably put it down to the glass and chrome frame. Screen lives up to expectations navigation is easy no button is somewhat refreshing. Animoji is hilariously fun! The black bar at the top isn’t annoying as people have made it seem I like that the icons look cute up there tucked away in the corner. Quality 10 Value A little steep considering the price of replacement if there is any damage. Features the same with a few extra perks. Smooth edges gorgeous finish.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,I got this phone on release date best thing i did apple has realy done good with the iphone x so HAPPY !,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"I bought the iPhone X as an upgrade for the 7Plus. While it is still new for me to make a full review I can’t fault it either. It is best iPhone I have owned. Besides the technology and new features inside this iPhone X, it looks, feels, works works very well for me not to forget to mention the size fits so well in the palm of my hand.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"I am not an Apple fan boy as I have had more Android handsets than iphones, but I have had every iPhone that apple has produced, well in sizes anyway. The iPhone X (Ten) is obviously the best. I know that Apple have just caught up with wireless charging and OLED screen before anyone starts saying that they have been behind for years, but here is the crunch, Apple have done it better! Wireless is the same, can't really top that, but the OLED screen is a master! No other smartphone produces the display in a way. Samsung, and the Chinese phones that say 'Near bezelless' are just that. They still have chins! Yes the iPhone has the notch, but after only a few hours you don't notice it. Then there is the 'No Home Button' honestly, once you are using the gestures you will wonder why you needed it! Face ID works perfectly and after using it for a week I can now open the phone as quick as I could with touch ID. As Apple always say...It just works. Now they have added the bits that android fans have been going on about for years this phone for me is now the best. IOS (Apples software) is awesome, can't say I will be using the Animoji that much, but down the line I am sure there will be some fantastic things that you will be able to do with it. Trust me, with the processing power this thing has it will handle IOS for the next 4 years easy. How long will android phones released this year get the latest version of android...? They will struggle. £1,000 is a lot of money, but when you take that over 4 years, compared to paying £500 for a android phone every year.... It's cheap!",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Just bought this phone fantastic service from very received on launch day am an Apple fan this phone is amazing very expensive but in my opinion just about worth it feels just right,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Ordered this phone 27th October and expected delivery 17th November, was emailed every step along the way and was excited to see that I was getting it on launch day instead, I got delivery early and started using it and fell in love :-) thankyou for my great experience",Very.co.uk

iphone,5,"Bought this on pre order, came on the exact day it was meant to. I am absolutely in love. I had the 6S before so it’s a big jump for me and I absolutely love it!

iphone,5,"I bought this 2 weeks ago, and I don’t think I could love the phone any more than I do. It is super fast, the screen is lovely and bright. I’ve worked in the phone industry and can tell you that the phone is super well made, Face ID is quick and unexpectedly efficient. I came from a Samsung s8 and it definitely an upgrade! And for the price I paid, definitely worth buying this over the XS, I saved £300!",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,L bought it last week great phone. Highly recommend buying from very.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Just ordered this in Black Friday as i was due an upgrade but decided it was a better idea to purchase the handset separately and get it on a buy now pay in 12 month deal through very, works out a lot cheaper! This phone is immense compared to the iphone 7 i was using, love the facial recognition so i can get rid of that awful home button and the screen makes everything look amazing, pictures videos, programmes, just general use! O and not to mention my daughter loves to use the animoji's and turn herself into a unicorn! thats a win win for me!",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Camera is a step up and the battery lasts ages. Definitely worth an upgrade from the 7.,Very.co.uk

iphone,5,"This iPhone is without a doubt the best I have used, it is also the fastest smartphone phone I have ever used. I have had every iPhone since the 4 and the is just on another level! Everything is so fluid it works beautifully and you get a really nice essences when you pick the phone up and may I also add that this iPhone X looks STUNNING. Yes the price is expensive but you really get what you paid for! Apple products are all about simplicity and ease of use and this is the definition of that.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Having tried the Iphone 6 and not liked it I was unsure about the X but am so glad I decided to try it. The facial recognition is really clever and the phone is not a lot heavier than my beloved iphone SE but has a nice large screen. It is blisteringly fast and does everything you would expect from a top of the range phone. The only downside is the high cost but with the cashback and 12 months interest free credit deal with Very it made more sense than to buy one under a tied phone contract. Lovely phone.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Very quick phone, very light and a lot of memory for my music",Very.co.uk
iphone,3,"I got this iPhone X to replace a 7 that my daughter will get but I’m not sure why now. It’s heavier than the 7, doesn’t have that much performance improvement over the 7 and cost a fortune really. The screen size is no improvement really and face recognition is really just a gimmick If I could send it back and wait for the next version I would but hey ho!",Very.co.uk
iphone,1,Bought last week since I bought I am not happy with product. If anyone read this think again go buy 8 plus. This phone is a huge disappointment. Phone constantly keep freezes. And that is happening more than 10 times a day. Contacted with Apple all they say update it. They doesn’t even know. When it’s freezes you have to force it to reboot. Couple of friends have same problem as well. I wish i could returned this phone and buy 8 plus.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"I’ve had this phone for about two weeks now and I love it! The camera is amazing, the screen is a great size, the speaker sounds great and the picture is much clearer than other iPhones. I must admit, it took a short while to get used to not having a button and having to swipe up to close the app I’m on, but now I’m just used to it. So much so, that when I go in my iPad I keep forgetting there is a button on that and keep swiping up to close the app. The Animoji feature is great fun too. Over all it’s a very good phone and I’d highly recommend.",Very.co.uk

iphone,2,Had this delivered on Saturday and straight away there was an issue with the display. The phone would randomly open apps and even deleted a few without any input. I spent the afternoon in an apple store having a new screen assembly fitted under the warranty as very didn’t let me return the item. Even Apple said I should return for a replacement but I knew it would be a pain to explain the situation over the phone. Luckily I had a video of the phone doing all of this which was taken on my wife’s mobile and as soon as the Apple employee saw it he knew it was faulty. The phone itself is great - now it’s workijg as it should but I can’t give the whole experience a positive review I’m afraid.,Very.co.uk

iphone,5,"I bought this as I needed a replacement to my iPhone 7 , this phone is night/day in comparison, software is a lot faster & apps easier to use , the only downside is the price...... , as I require a lot of memory I went for the 256GB model & very expensive:(",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,I bought this phone last week and it is working wonders in my life. I’m lovin it.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"I bought this phone as birthday present for myself. It is very expensive but the phone is very slick. Upgraded from a iPhone 7. The iPhone X is slightly heavier, battery life is good and the screen is fantastic.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,i bought this phone it’s suiteble and i recommend to all friend to have same phone,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Loving the new screen and features - no problems so far!,Very.co.uk
iphone,4,Having used this phone for a few weeks now it’s easy to get used to the lack of a home button. The gestures are flawless and work each time. Face ID works great too and have tested that with others and it really can recognise your voice.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,I bought it week ago and I am very happy that I did it,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Bought this phone from very, arrived 2 weeks early. Amazing service and an amazing phone. If you’ve got the money get it! If you haven’t ‘Very’ it! 0% and a few month to pay it off! Most expensive phone I’ve ever had but it is worth it.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Delivered just before Christmas and using it to the full. Was reluctant about loosing the home button but now I think it’s better without. The display , camera is out of this world.",Very.co.uk
iphone,4,Arrived far earlier than suggested. As always super intuitive and so easy to set up just by switching sim and of course iCloud. The loss of the home button is taking time to manage especially as I have the 8 plus too. Occasionally face recognition won’t work and at the oddest times. Not for example in the middle of the night when everything is pitch black. Struggling with app downloads which isn’t the case on the 8 plus Onwards and upwards. Hoping some improvements are in the pipeline but if you cut me in 2 you would see Apple so no chance of me reconsidering my choice of provider,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Had this in time for christmas hubby love it smart looking phone,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Awesome phone with great display. Best phone on the market.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Fastest iPhone so far loving it had it now for 3 weeks so happy bit on the expensive side other wise all good,Very.co.uk
iphone,4,"At first I wasn’t too sure due to the price, first thing I noticed was the speed of the new iPhone over previous phones. Camera is by far the best yet and the ability to take photos in low level light is excellent see example of this. I have also found the battery life really good and sound is great. I would of given 5 stars only reason why not is the price, and the Face ID it’s very cool but to be honest not really needed.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"So after a couple of years using Android because I was board of the same old iPhone design I decided to switch back to Apple and I Purchased the iPhone X 256GB in Space grey, I'm so glad I did the phone is amazing and built so well, prior to this I had a galaxy s8 and this is such a better phone in every way. I know its expensive but its worth every penny in my option.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Been using this phone for 3 days,I can’t complain. the iphone looks smaller than the iPhone 7 Plus I had. That’s due to the larger screen. Like the new features, it will take a little time as I’m still missing the home button.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,This Has to be the greatest iPhone ever made. It’s looks Fantastic and feels great in the hand.,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Excellent mobile,I’m very happy for my phone. Thank you Apple.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Am glad that I bought the iPhone X. One of the best phone in the market,Very.co.uk
iphone,1,"IPhone X when it’s working is amazing. However after having the iPhone for 6hours the screen as become completely unresponsive, after restoring the whole phone via iTunes, nothing on the screens works or the Face ID. So you can’t even set it up again. It’s got the screen software fix installed. And surprise surprise there thousand of people online having the same problem. And it’s a huge problem getting it changed under normal warranty. Apple wants the full amount it cost to hold unti it’s repaired and proven not to be your fault and also there is no spare handsets as it’s still on back order. A NIGHTMARE, knew I should of taken the leap",Very.co.uk
iphone,4,Good phone but overpriced no phone should be This sort of money,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Was sceptical, about the IPhone X but it’s amazing and much better than expected. The best upgrade yet!",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,Received on day one and i can honestly say this is a beautiful phone yes it is expensive but realistically its only £200 more than the iPhone 8. The phone is easy to use it can be strange having no home button but you do get used to it. Bigger screen but smaller phone i had the iPhone Plus plus phones for years and it was always a pain to carry it but this phone fits in my pocket very easily. Very happy with my purchase,Very.co.uk
iphone,5,The best phone I have ever owned. New gestures are intuitive and work well. The camera is amazing,Very.co.uk
iphone,4,"I've had this for a week now and tried out most features including AR. AR is quite something, I've played a few games including the Machines game that was demo's in the phone showcase by apple and it's really something, scrabbling around on the floor to get the best angles to see my characters shooting up the opponents. FaceID is superior to touch ID in everyway and works in low light/no light. They've done a superb job of it. My one niggle is that I came from the iPhone 6s Plus, if you're used to a larger screen, this is a step backwards in width, height is about right but width is hampered and you notice it. If you can maybe wait for the Plus version next year. All in all though it's a great phone, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. I knocked a star off for the price. Very were fantastic, I pre ordered the phone just after it went live at 8am, think I clocked in at 5 past, delivery was made on release day by Royal Mail.",Very.co.uk

iphone,5,"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got.",Very.co.uk
iphone,5,"Yes it’s expensive but for me you get what you pay for. Great phone, great new features and I don’t miss the home button!!

galaxy,4,"Bought this Sumsung 9 a month ago. Loved it until the latest update, which I totally hate. I feel Samsung is treating me like a child. They do not give me a choice of 'when we do this essential update would you like the look of your apps to change to this as well? Can we change what facilities you have in this area to this?' The latest update has also reduced my battery life by a good 30%, one of the main reasons I stuck with Samsung. My hope is Samsung sort this out for the next update.

As the Note 9 was slightly outside my budget, the reduced price of the S9+ was very attractive proposition. So far (after 2 weeks) I am very pleased with the phone. It works well. I like the improved screen brightness and better BT profiles for my headphones. I like the way Samsung try to keep in touch via emails to encourage use of features. I do prefer the slightly wider format of my Note 3. The keyboard is less tight and easier to use on the Note 3. I don't think much of Bixby (like so many others) and has disabled it as much as I can. Maybe Samsung will get there with this feature....Overall it is a great phone.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I got S9 about three weeks ago and so far it's been good had a little trepidation on software upgrade because of bad press but no need as all went well,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I started a contract with the s9 recently and have had an overall amazing experience with the phone. The camera is one of the best that i have used on a phone with a very sleek design and a host of fun and useful features. I do however think that bixby is kinda unneeded as i only ever use it to set an alarm when being to lazy to do so but you still have to get into the phone before being able to do so thus making it kinda pointless. Overall it has a really good set of specks that i would recommend to anyone wanting a fun gaming experience. Thanks.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I've been an iPhone user for years and decided to change to a Samsung s9 and I'm super impressed with everything the photo quality is amazing only problem I'm having is transferring my iCloud emails as iPhone have so many restrictions but I'll work it out .

galaxy,2,Had s8 for 2 years even ran it over with a skid steer and still worked for a bit the s9 had for 3 days while life proof case was being delivered was sitting at a table dropped it 4 inches and screen broke needs to be stronger like a plastic screen not glass and camera unless perfectly still is blurry unless it's on pro setting then it's good but overall still a great phone and would recommend it over an iPhone anyday,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,Still getting used to the phone seems a bit fiddly at the moment with trying to go back on screens.. e.g. on what's app you go back at the top left hand corner every other time you go back from the bottom right hand corner.

galaxy,4,"I've had my phone for a few months now and I am enjoying it. Overall, it's a great product. I only have two complaints. The first being that the fingerprint scanner is in an inconvenient place, if the phone is lying on a surface you have to lift it to unlock and more significantly when you use the scanner you will frequently end up smudging the camera lens. Secondly, after only having my phone for a month, I have a major scratch (and quite a lot of micro scratches) in the centre of the screen. I can't fathom how this is possible. I bought an expensive, protective case and I've been very careful with it (never in a pocket or bag shared with keys or anything). I was MUCH more careless with my S7, yet it has less damage to the screen.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,It's simular to the S8 but with this a new model of phone it's better in its ways Which are some Than the S8 One thing that's been to of a noticeable degree is the camera The photos remind me of a professional quality but is it a good thing or bad I'm undecided yet with my phone only a recent purches I'm loving it's back Mine is blue with now a clear Tech 21 clear case which allows my phone's back cover to shine through Giving it that more of a feel Hey it's a S9 not an S8 Which is great because I'm not a tech geek So I miss out their But loving the phone and the great contract deals for it's purches I believe with these phones you are getting what you pay for if it's high end tech your into for quality Alround and cosmetic looks. 10/10.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"The phone is very good and works as i want it. The only 2 problems i have is the bixby button should be able to be disabled as it is in just the wrong spot. Erganomics for it are good but for if you are allways meaning to press it. Also because of the curved screen i have found that screen protectors break if to much pressure is put on it in the right spot, this is not a fault with the phone but could be good if a adapted screen protector came with the phone.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Glad to have a Samsung back. Tried iPhone and didn't like it.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Brilliant phone. Read a load of rubbish from Techradar etc. Can't fault it. Bought the original Galaxy then the S2 then S4 then S5 mini followed by the S6 so I know what I'm talking about. All depends on how you use it. Simple,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Just come back to the Samsung family and I'm glad I did. The galaxy s9 is amazing. It's fast the camera is amazing it's just such a great phone. Samsung make the best and most featured packed android phones. Also the new software Samsung one ui is awesome,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I got this phone on contract a couple of weeks back, I absolutely love it... it's actually the best Samsung I've used... the battery life lasts so long the sound on this phone is literally amazing whether you listen through headphones or speaker, good quality only thing is as soon as it arrived my son knocked it onto the floor &there's a dent on it already so to me it's very temperamental, but with a case to protect the phone... no problem.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,No better than s7 Battery does not last a day. Fingerprint unlock does not function well and is needed in low light.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,The Samsung s9 is the best and the back up team has been invaluable,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"It's such a great phone, I went from iPhone to Samsung and got used to it straight away, its so easy to use and amazing features, only issue I do have is not able to use Samsung pay due to not supporting my bank, but I'm able to use Google pay instead, great phone",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I'm a massive fan of the Galaxy and this is definitely a big step up from the S7 Edge I had previously. The camera is incredibly sharp, the speaker's great and the fingerprint scanner is more accurate (I'm still not sure I find it convenient having it on the back, but it's better visually). The only thing keeping me from a 5-star rating is an ongoing Galaxy problem where notification sounds stop working every now and then, seemingly at random. But overall I'm extremely happy!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I never had 256gb phone, s9 plus is my first. Excellent storage and battery.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and after all the comments from friends who have Samsung Galaxy phones [from S6 to S9] it was my dream phone. I am a little disappointed with it. When it arrived I found that the buttons are in a slightly inconvenient place and it's not as easy to operate as my previous Sony Xperia was. I find it awkward to hold without hitting the button to activate Bixby, but I am sure I'll get used to it [it's got to last me a long while]. I find it awkward to close apps I have finished with whilst keeping the current app open. It appears that I can only ""close all"". When I bought the phone I didn't get any accessories, just the handset, so it might have been far easier to navigate if I had a user manual. Lastly the battery life isn't as good as my previous phone. I had hoped for longer. I am still glad I bought it and am confident it will be much more pleasurable to use once I am more familiar wit it. I am certainly not rushing to replace it.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I got my phone a fortnight ago and have been recommending it to my friends and family.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Samsung Galaxy S9 is a great phone. It's a perfect Samsung. The interface features on this phone are very user friendly. Performance is great and the Samsung s9 is beautifully designed. I am loving the Samsung S9. The S9 gets 5 star ratings from me.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"This phone was easy to set up, removing unwanted stuff was easy and you can do so much from just the over all look or go deeper into code which i really appreciate about android phones. This is my first Samsung phone and i am really happy with it.The camera takes great pictures and i'm quite in depth with photography with a DLSR canon camera, which in my eyes this makes this phone the best I've seen in my hands for picture quality. If you want freedom go with Samsung its truly great phone I've held it for a considerable amount of time and the build quality is really good i haven't dropped it yet but im sure it will withstand drops from my hand or pocket.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"I obtained this just over a week ago. Better than a S7 , I had before",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Upgraded from the S7, and love the bigger screen on the S9. The audio is superb and the AKG headphones, coupled with the Dolby Atmos processing, is fantastic. However, some of the features I'd gotten used to with my S7 have gone - primarily, personalised text alert tones. A simple but effective way of identifying who's messaged, without having to dig the phone out of your coat pocket/handbag. If you're expecting an important text, and then get a text from a friend, you won't be panicking to find the phone! Other than that, I'm loving the phone so far, and though not explored all the camera features, I'm really impressed with the photos I've taken so far.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I changed from ios to android, everyone I know have always said it's a difficult change but it hasn't been, using the Samsung s9 has been fairly easy it's taking a while to learn how to do things that I use to do with my iOS but I'm getting there slowly, I'm loving the camera on the phone it is so much better than the iOS, it's a great phone and I'm glad I took the large step in changing to android.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I love this phone. It's cute, and amazing in almost every way. The only downside is the screen. It scratches easily, and any screen cover makes typing hard. Also the preloaded software is pretty pushy.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,This phone is a good phone but its randomly coming up with adds when I open the phone and it's doing my head in it wont say on Wii more then an hour,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,"I am not happy with Samsung. I bought an unlocked phone and I should be treated better by Samsung for doing so. Instead, all the carrier branded ones get their updates before my unlocked version did. And their updates are already slow in the first place.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I continue with Samsung phones because of reliability and ease of use,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Purchased a week ago. Previously had s6 and s7 edge and this phone is another step up in all departments. Notable mention must go to the camera which is fantastic in high and low light and screen is quality. As to be expected its packed with features and looks brilliant... one down side (nit picking) is the battery life remains simular to the s7 edge I had previously, but still lasts a day easy. Highly recommended.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Upgrade from s7 edge brilliant phone more features,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I left apple after 9 years and was a little worried I may have made the wrong choice,but I had nothing to worry about my S9 is so much better than any iPhone and cheaper",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Only had it a short time still enjoying the phone & apps & surprises it still holds to be discovered as & when I come across them. Would have liked Samsung Health to allow me to use one of my fit watches that I have to link too Samsung Health.,Very.co.uk

The screen is nice and big and therefore legible. Good quality photos. Easy to set up (though I got help from my son, I must confess!).

galaxy,5,Feels great. Looks great. Performs tirelessly Month on and can't find fault.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought this a week ago and it’s great. Easy to operate and very slick.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,I wouldnt recomend this phone. s8 plus is way better i regret selling my s8 plus to buy s9. Self emoji filter isnt all that neither. Planning on selling my s9 to get another s8plus.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I used to have iPhones but was persuaded to go for a Samsung Galaxy this time and so far ( 2 weeks) I am glad I changed!! Excellent features and better value for one's money,!! A",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I upgraded my contract to get this phone. The camera is really great quality. The screen and sound I can't fault at all. The Bixby voice feature is actually really handy normally I find these kinds of feature more of a gimic but this is a genuinely useful tool when in the car for example. The Bixby button initially found it got in the way accidentally pressing it when trying to turn volume down. It would be good if you could use that button for something else such as a camera shortcut or to take photos. The size and quality of the screen is top quality for watching movies or videos on the go. I found the charging port in the Samsung A5 2017 I had very temperamental and fell out easily. This made me doubt the USB-C connection. The S9 has resolved this issue with a good firm positive connection with the charging lead that sits flush with the bottom of the phone and plastic reinforce of the lead. The addition to the conversions for adapting the USB connectors and micro were really handy and made set up and transferring content a breeze. Locking and unlocking. The iris scanner and facial recognition previously I thought were again a marketing point rather than a functional feature of the phone. The S9 again does this really well and will unlock faster than I can type the 4 to get Password. No issues found with these features.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,I don't like using back fingerprint as I normally use it for navigation system so I have to remove out of dash board holder to reset which is very inconvenient. I also haven't being able to connect on my Facebook and Instagram. Also the picture is not clear as my other samsang 8.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,I bought this after much deliberation between the Huawei and the so I'm happy I chose the s9 as the phone feels so much comfort in hand granted the camera isn't as good however I'm not much of a photographer anyways the speed is impeccable and the nice little edge apps feature is fantastic makes sure I never need to waste time trying to find apps the sound quality is amazing although I'm yet to test the akg In ear earphones I'm sure they will live up to expectations I'm looking forward to using this for next few years and exploring more features,Very.co.uk

The phone unlocks when I wipe the screen but that is no biggy. I'm a little disappointed by the satnav as it says the signal is weak whenever I use it, but that might be me.

The phone is not only beautiful to look at, lightweight and simple to use, but the difference in the clarity and speed out performs my old phone ten fold. The 'wall to wall' screen with it's fantastic resolution makes watching films and videos a pleasure. With the new, surround sound feature, with the Atmos switched on makes it a real 'cinematic' experience. No more need for external speakers which is superb!

I'm slowly getting used to my new Sumsung but it's not as simple or intuitive to use as the Nokia was. The Samsung phone settings are harder to control and having random app's (instead of being in alphabetical order) is driving me mad. I tended to use less than 1Gb data a month with my Windows phone, even with roaming switched on. With my new Samsung I've had to turn data roaming off as I used over 1Gb data in the first 2 weeks, which I wasn't expecting, and I still haven't downloaded as many app's as I had on the Windows phone.

The phone itself is super sleek and has a great look to it, it feels very sturdy and comfortable in my hands and it's also huge! The screen is massive and takes two hands to use properly but the one-hand function helps that.

galaxy,4,Just glad to be away from apple and go back to samsung,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I've had my S9 for almost a week now and am enjoying exploring the new features, bit by bit. The new bigger screen is a special treat as is the heightened High Definition display. I also like the fact that it is a bit more compact than my S7 Edge. Have yet to try out the camera but do like the easier photo album display system. It just feels easier to use. One small niggly bit is that the touch screen seems just a trifle sluggish compared to the S7. It may be me, but I am getting used to it. I'm defo pleased to have upgraded to the S9. Oh, and the battery does seem to last longer on charge compared to my previous phone. I only had the S7 for 18 months so its battery wouldn't have been weakening in such a short space of time. Let's see, what else? Oh, yes...…..it definitely charges up faster, as well. Haven't tried Bixby yet. That's next. One other thing; I am pleased that the sim/SD tray arrangement is the same as the S7. Nothing new to have to get used to.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,I bought the s9 and couldn't make or recive calls on the 1st S9 then I got a second one and that had other issues going straight to speaker phone when receiving calls. At 1st I tried a sim swap which didn't fix the issue. I'm really disappointed with Samsung after having them for years. Other than the basic call making the camera is fab but the ar emoji is useless as you can't add beards or size of figures.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,Battery life is no better than my Samsung j6 16 ...,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I got this upgrade last week and im thrilled with the new device,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,"My first curved screen, what a mistake. It's a nightmare to hold, too big to be comfortable. The curved screen means when held you're constantly clicking things down the side. Even the settings to reduce this don't help. Finding decent protective cases is a nightmare, none work perfectly, if they protect the glass they make it impossible to click anything down the sides, if they protect the fragile sides, the phone becomes even clunkier and makes using it and in hand ache. I stupidly dropped mine and the screen cracked, half the screen stopped working and my cheapest quote for repair was £400. Luckily I pay for insurance so got it swapped quicky and easily. The Samsung interface is also annoying. Bixby constantly appears, always unwanted and trying to disable it is a nightmare and I could never totally get rid. It preferences it's own internet browser and sometimes there's no option to use another, same with opening links and apps when opened don't go to the appropriate apps you'd like. It seems very locked in and unfortunately going the way of Apple. Positives tho, the screen resolution is great, the phone is fast and reliable, and the camera is amazing. - auto focus is lacking, and it's impossible to focus closer than 3 to 5 inches away. Sometimes annoying but I managed to get around this with a third party lense kit that clips over the camera. Sound quality is also OK, better than my TV sometimes, but worse than many other phones I've had in the last few years.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought this phone to replace my S8+. This S9 is brilliant and recommend it.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,This device was chosen along with the Galaxy Smartwatch as a contract upgrade. I've only had them a fortnight but I am very impressed. I've been using Galaxy smartphones for a number of years and the S9 is the best yet.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I've had my phone for nearly a wk loving all the features,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"It has a lot of features I have no real need for but I purpose they're handy for some eg. Bixby. I like that it's a lot faster and smoother than my S6 but the blue light filter is really yellow in comparison so I don't use that. I like the side bar for quick access to commonly used apps and contacts, the create an emoji feature, the colour options and the dolby sound. It seems to charge slower than my old phone.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I have had Samsung Galaxy phones for the past 9 years and they get better and better. All my colleagues have i-phones and every one of them had considerable issues with the new versions, my Galaxy just updated to everything, even the car, with almost negligible effort on my part.

galaxy,3,I bought 2 weeks ago and had problems with the screen and the charging port..which has been fixed. The phone doesn't zoom in as the s7 did which is a pain for diminishing eyesight It's an overrated toy...far to expensive for what you get..lucky I had insurance on my old phone Bixby is a pain and keeps opening..I'm not interested in it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Had this phone for a few weeks having upgraded from iPhone 7. I had had the equivalent Samsung previously. This is a step up from both. Facial recognition is not on a par with iPhone X but in other respects this is a good equivalent but better priced! Battery life is good if the phone is not run 'flat-out'. The ability to expand memory is a great benefit over any iPhone. Camera, sound and signal excellent - works well as a phone!",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I've moved from Apple to Android so I'm going through a bit of a learning curve. First impressions are that this is a great phone, I love the quality of the photos and it's quite easy to navigate for an Android / Samsung newbie. Frustratingly Barclays doesn't support Google pay or Samsung pay and I don't like Barclay' s alternative (mobile pay is always switched on without prior activation) but, while that gripe sits with Barclays rather than Samsung, it's worth noting. One other minor gripe is the alarm clock - alarm tones are limited and when the alarm goes off it quickly goes from a wake up whisper to GET OUT OF BED NOW volume, regardless of the volume setting being at its lowest.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I got this phone for the new year and I'm so pleased with it! Amazing features and a great phone altogether.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Easy to use, lovely colour, easy to sync with older phone",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,I am bitterly disappointed and it's not a 64gb version it's a 128gb version and for 800 pound I can honestly say with all the problems I have so far encountered with the phone I wouldn't recommend it. I bought it so I wouldn't struggle with apps freezing etc and I am bitterly disappointed.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"Recently updated. Miss my S7, if I want to use letters of buttons from the side I have to really press down. Not sure if this is due to the case (which is meant for the phone) but it's like pressing keys for a Nokia. Camera quality is poor.. blurs at the slightest move forward facing and doesn't like to focus particularly on more than 2 people in a selfie. Doesn't give notifications like the S7, I've played with the settings and I'll keep playing but got to say, I'm not in love with my me phone.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,Had nothing with issues with my s9 either it crash and the constant issue with the moisture sensor going off and can only charge in wireless also means battery doesn't last a whole day,Very.co.uk

galaxy,2,"Had this phone all of a week before sending back. It's not much diffetent to my S7. The camera is slow, unresponsive and low quality. The phone itself was clunky and apps were struggling every now and then. It looks stunning and the video quality was amazing but in general I found it slow and disappointing. As a Samsung fan this was a let down. Hoping the S10 has more to offer.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Everything is great about it, but the battery seems to die quicker after a few weeks. Hopefully it's just me. But everything else is alright.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Everything works as you'd expect of a Samsung Galaxy. The best feature I've found so far is the ability to import over everything from my old phone using an App, useful for contacts etc, but even better it copied the Wifi from previous logins. Very Happy",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I've been using Samsung Galaxy S devices since the first one and the S9 is by far my favorite Android device. The only thing I find annoying is the short battery life compared to other flagship phones,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,This phone makes me happy! Have it all:) I can take the office out with me!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,After using iPhone for over 10 years I decided that they did not warrant the premium price tag now being applied to the phone I switched to the S9 and so far have been very impressed I now have a phone which rivals the iPhone X for the price of an iPhone 7 It will take a lot for Apple to regain me as a customer in the future,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Better then apple and cheaper . Better features better battery,Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"Very good phone, breathtaking camera and amazing screen. The speakers are great. Only complaint is the battery but it still lasts me a day with at least 15 percent battery left.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"I bought this a couple of months ago and use extensively. I love the face ID, finger print as well as the whole phone feel. The operating system is also great with so many options to customise the phone to your liking. However what I fail to understand is the camera. On my past phone (iPhone 6s) the picture quality was good but nothing amazing. The galaxy s9 intrigued me with the dual camera and advanced manual modes but sadly I'm very disappointed. The front facing camera is AWFUL, unless in very bright situations faces are very soft and grainy. The outside camera is much better but again in low light situations terrible. I really expected great images as this was a key selling point but sad to say it is false. It's a real shame because otherwise it's a pretty perfect phone. I guess I'll just have to go back to Apple:( So if you want to take photos, this isn't the phone for you. If not I highly recommend it. Samsung please keep up with rival phones pictures. Thank you!",Very.co.uk

Everything works as it should and I have no complaints about the phone. The headphones though, they are way beyond my ears so are wasted, they sit really bad and I would have preferred the old samsung headphones as they were much better for me",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Samsung S9 has Great features and design for one to handle.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I upgraded from the Samsung S7 to this S9 and was extremely pleased with the ease of doing this using Carphone Warehouse; and the Samsung transfer process was easy, albeit it was a little slower than expected.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,"After owning the phone just two weeks I am back to my S7. Numerous problems including contious pop ups, poor 4G connectivety, poor phone reception and dead spots on the screen making it a complete nightmare to switch wifi on and off. I persevered with it until day 6 it fell out of my pocket on to the hard airport floor. The screen instantly cracked all around. Now finding it will cost in excess of 200 pounds and I will still have the numerous other issues I have decided to abandon it. It feels like a real step backwards from the S7 which has served me faithfully this last 2 years. I hope it will last another two years of the S9 contract which I regret very much taking out as the phone in my opinion is not of the quality claimed by Samsung.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"Physical buttons not in the same place as other phones so not intuitive. Battery drains quickly. No obvious features to justify the price. Intrusive features e.g. why would an alarm clock need access to my photos and files? For privacy reasons, won't use half the features on the phone. Not worth the money. Basic device at very costly price.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,I bought this phone just over a week ago and it honestly doesn't seem much different to my old s7 edge,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Very good phone and excellent camera. Bixby is annoying, but I've mostly disabled it. Switch to USB-C is a good thing (micro-USB dying was the main problem on my S7). I have only two real complaints: 1. Placing the fingerprint sensor right next to the camera lens is stupid! I end up with fingerprints all over the lens 2. Why on earth don't Samsung provide a simple case like the one I had on the S7. The closest seems to be the one with a transparent front. I don't want that - I don't want the 'always on' alerts and time/date. I want a simple leatherette case but one which wakes up the phone when I open it (and puts it to sleep when I close it) as I had on the S7. This also had the advantage that simply flipping the case open and closed would snooze the alarm which was great!",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I've been using this phone in place of my old S6 for a few months now alongside the Galaxy Watch. I'm very impressed with the speed and ease of use especially with the fingerprint scanner now in a much more easy to use position which switches on and unlocks the device in a trice. So far I've had no glitches except I find Iris Scan sometimes fails in bright light conditions so usually use fingerprint. Samsung Pay is very slick a treat to use and does not interfere with the use of my Barclaycard contactless app. The only fault I can find, which was also on the S6 and much talked about on the forums, is that Smart Lock, Trusted Places, is a bit flaky. When you arrive home it works but after the four hour time out, when you unlock it manually again it stops working until you go out and come home again! This is not a problem if you have the watch or some other Bluetooth device at home to keep it unlocked.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Had this phone as a gift for Christmas and have loved it since. It performs great, the camera quality is amazing, I can play high performance games that my old Galaxy J5 could never handle. I haven't found any major issues so far other than the Bixby button. I know that I would never use Bixby because it's just something that I've never particularly liked, so having a button dedicated to something I will never use seems quite useless. I have disabled both Bixby and the button, but now I just have a redundant useless button that I can do nothing about. The ability to re-map this button to something that the user finds more useful like play/pause media or take screenshot or something like that would seriously put my opinion of this phone much higher. Thanks",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"This was a gift from my daughter and son inlaw om very pleased with it so far but having trouble moving icons as I did with my S8 it's quite frustrating also copy and paste is obviously different as I can't seem to get it to work as before , hence my score.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,"I've had this phone for about 3 weeks. I've always been fond of Samsung. I do like the phone overall- there's a good camera and I like the size. It took me a little while to get used to not having a home button but I quickly got over that. Unfortunately the battery does drain quickly and I find I have to charge it at least once, sometimes twice, to make it through the day. I guess that's probably due to its large screen. Bixby (the siri equivalent) is also very irritating. I don't like having a button to activate Bixby, it's easy to accidentally hit, especially as it sits right next to the volume button. Bixby Home is also unwanted. Another issue I have had is with the curved screen. Despite it looking nice, it isn't always practical. For example, when using apps or games on your phone, when an advert pops up which you wish to close, it can be difficult to do so as the 'x' is usually in the top corners where the screen bends. For some reason, the screen is less sensitive here and I find myself spending a while trying to close anything that may pop up. If you can live with these downsides, then otherwise it seems like a great phone.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,So happy with the features on the S9 and the camera takes clear amazing pictures.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Very pleased with this phone.The camera and storage is superb,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"only one flaw, on/off button is right opposite sound buttons . sometimes as you lower or raise volume , you end up pressing the on/off button as well when you hold phone in one hand",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Got this beauty on Christmas eve, great big screen, perfect sensitivity. Got excellent pics on Christmas day and the sound quality is better than any phone I've ever had. The battery also lasts 2 days even with me constantly on it which I love. I can't get enough of it x",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Had a S7 edge which was great, so looked at the reviews for S9 plus, and they where positive with a better camera which is important to me.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Was going to change my phone..so happy I did...Best present by far,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"I upgraded to the s9 from the s7edge about a week ago and I as yet I am not that impressed. I am not keen on the fingerprint scanners placement on the back of the unit, I find it awkward to use. This may be something that I get used to in time, however when at work my phone will sit face up on my desk and used to be able to access my phone with the scanner at the front. Bixby is a nice idea but I struggle to get it to work successfully 100% of the time. This again may need me to invest some time to it and set up all the features to make the most of it. I have been disappointed with the voice unlock feature as have made several unsuccessful attempts to set this up. I like the easy access to apps sections as well as the multiple options to arrange to home page. I am a huge fan of Samsung phones and hope that with a bit more attention and research to the features I will get the best out of the Samsung S9.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,"After going from the note 3 to this s9+, I really see how lazy Samsung has become, sure there are a few newer features in hardware such as better screen resolution, brightness, better speakers etc. However I feel the phone is more stupid and dumb than ever before, Android 5.0 was simplistic yet blunt, 8.0 along with Samsung software just feels over complicated and annoying, bloated with rubbish you can't uninstall like Bixby (not used and never will) I've been a Samsung android guy for 15 years, and even I'm confused on why the software is the way it is, there is just no need for most of it. I feel like this has the potential to be powerful but is held back by useless stuff, this has 6gb ram that's double my note 3 with it's 3gb ram, yet the os takes up 4gb!? POINTLESS!

The camera quality is just amazing I can't believe how sharp the photos are.

galaxy,4,"I have always had a Samsung phone and got the S9 a few weeks ago. It looks great but for me the curved screen is a negative. Apps I am using are actually off the screen and sometimes buttons I need are on the ""curve"" and restrict what I need to do. I don't actually see the benefit of a curved screen? Is there any?",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Wish I had bought the iPhone XR. The face recognition fails to work with any consistency despite being reloaded numerous times. Disappointing.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"The samsung S9 ""is what it is"" a great flagship mobile phone really good quality what can I say. Great looks good storage, amazing picture & video quality. Bixby is a very good feature. Easy to use and understand love how you can now use a usb connection with the provided connector. Switching from phone to phone was easy enough. The only downside I think is the battery could have been much better, as it runs out quite quick after a fair amount of use. I also like the wireless charging feature, I recently purchased a wireless charging dock which works pretty well, let's hope samsung can keep up the good work with their updates that would be something to behold, but hey let's hope for the best. Overall a excellent phone.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I upgraded from a Samsung S6. The slightly larger screen is great but it's still small enough to fit in my pocket. Battery life is good for the day even though I use it a lot--especially to read or play games. I've played with Bixby a little and it's handy to have the button for access but I'm used to saying Ok Google which is very responsive in this phone so may not use Bixby much. Depends on future capabilities. Overall very happy about my purchase.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Just as I expected and much more! Much more than I ever need but I know it's there should I.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I bought this in April. As Samsung have now made the phones sealed, battery life is very important as i can no longer swap out the battery on a day out. I prefer to do this as power banks are much heavier and then theres the cable to carry. So i got the S9 with its longer lasting battery. All ok until about oct when i found i had to charge it a lot more. By dec im starting the day at 100% then having to charge 2 more times. On a recent day out in London my phone was dead by 5pm and i had barely used it. Not impressed. The rest of the phone is great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"I was happy with my S7 but i had finished my contract. So i got the S9. The Bixby button is annoying and i haven't found a way to replace it's action. The edge is annoying at times when I want to press something on the border of my screen. The biometrics are brilliant, but i wish there was a way to quickly disable them so one cannot be forced into looking at the iris sensor. Overall the phone is fast and packed full of features, but i wish i could remap Bixby and disable biometrics on the lockscreen.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I've moved up from the s7 edge to the s9 . I thought the s7 was an excellent phone but the s9 is just so much better everything seems improved even though I thought the s7 was perfect . The phone is still the best looking phone and fits in my hand just right I have no problems using it one handed and all the apps run so smooth the camera still takes great shots even in low light and the speakers are the best I've heard on a phone the music just sounds so crisp and clear with no vibration noise like so other phones . So all in all I have to say I just love everything about the phone.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,"Screen is much smaller than my S7 edge for starters. Biggest gripe is with Samsung loading all of their awful software on to their phones. Stuff nobody wants. Then, they are so slow updating the OS on their devices whilst regularly updating their,own apps. Features and menus are well hidden. Huawei next for me.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"For the price it should have been 5g ready, but I suppose that's going to be the new thing with the s10. Everything else I like does what I need it to do, the 3500 battery lasts 2 days even with using Spotify for a few hours..128gb + the cloud so more than enough storage. Camera and it's emoji features are a nice addition compared to my old s6.. all in all its a great phone! Overall rating is only 4☆ As it's not 5g ready",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I got my phone just over a week ago and I'm loving it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I purchased this phone as a replacement for my galaxy S7 and the phone immediately not only feels better in the hand, but is faster and looks better. The phone is a very nice subtle, and not garish colour. The placement of the bixby button is poor, with me often pressing the button instead of the volume down button or when taking a screenshot. I would prefer it if the button was removed altogether and bixby respond to something along the lines of ""Hey Bixby"". The change to the new charging a data transfer port was, as it always inevitably will be, rather inconvenient. However the inclusion of a male to female converter which I can attach to my old charging cable is brilliant and shows a fantastic attention to detail. The camera is fantastic, and I have nothing specific to mention bar the fact that a filter should be fine tuned and created to allow people who have reef aquariums, with lighting that requires very tedious professional mode tweaking to avoid the image being awash blue, to use a filter which automatically does this. A quick google will reveal many people having this same issue with all phones and the addition of this filter would put the phone ahead especially in the reefing community where a large sum of people are turning to third party applications.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,"Good phone, good fat hardware. Always the latest software on top of the range Samsung phones. Small form factor despite large screen. My main reason for using Samsung phones is their efficient use of ram and the fact they are fairly future proof compared with other phones I've had. Ram doesn't clog up if you close apps regularly, and apps don't become unusable due to software obsolescence. Big down size is from the s7 onwards it is glass backed, and glass fronted. I my s7 I had two insurance claims within six months from simply dropping my phone. Make no mistake, if you drop it it will shatter. My current phone is the s9. It is slim, and with its infinity screen should be easy to use with one hand....BUT it isn't, as like many other galaxy users i have to carry it around in a large bulky case and use a screen protector. COME ON SAMSUNG THE TECHNOLOGY FOR TOUGHENED GLASS WAS AROUND ON MY ORIGINAL SONY XPERIA ALONG TIME AGO. MAYBE NEXT UPGRADE I WILL SWITCH FOR THIS REASON AND THIS REASON ALONE. This move towards phone fragility seems to be a sinister money making move, but as everyone seems to be carrying there mobiles in egg boxes these days , it might be a wiser move to stand out from the crowd and build a toughened glass small form factor phone. IF YOU STOP BUILDING PHONES OUT OF EGG SHELLS I WILL STICK WITH SAMSUNG ON MY NEXT UPGRADE!",Very.co.uk

The phone I really wanted was out of my price range but I thought Samsung would be ok. And it is only an 'ok'. I've turned Bixby off, didn't need it & prefer to stick with Google pay instead of Samsung pay.

Not any use if you take pics of your kids. Didn’t pick up my fingerprint to unlock or it took 3/4 attempts. The retina access did not work on my eyes either.

galaxy,5,"I got this phone for my (early) christmas present and it's so good!! I love the feature where you can use the fingerprint sensor to pull the bar at the top down and the facial recognition is really good quality.

galaxy,5,"I've always had Samsung phones and the s9 is by far the best I've had so far...the slim design and look is exactly what I was looking for when I upgraded from the s7 edge...no home button and a crystal clear screen, with easy to use functions and interface have got it the 5 stars...",Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,After over 10yrs using apple phones its taking a while to adjust to android. Some things are better but others not as slick hate messenger as keeps wanting to select a preferred one and keeps switching which is a pain as lost some messages.

galaxy,5,"I spent quite a while looking at different makes/models of phone, but having an S7 edge previously, I knew that I was safe with Samsung. I love the new features, especially for the camera.

galaxy,4,"Been apple since day 1. I was getting bored of the set up and also paying top money every 2 years to get a bit more screen size. It's a well thought out process that's in place to aid iPhone users to sync with samsung. I was shocked at how easy (although lengthy. Overnight) the syncing was and everything went across fine. Only comment is about the MMS situation. All my family and friends are 90% apple so imessage has gone. Only realised this when my phone company sent me a txt to say I had already done a tenner and did in messaging. A bit of advice on this would have been nice. All in all, a refreshing change and I like it.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"Don't think fingerprint reader in best place, amazing screen, some times loses Wi-Fi for no reason, brilliant camera, can take a second longer than old I phone to load apps and web pages, all in all a great phone though prob overpriced, not massively better than old I phone 6 if at all, battery lasts a lot longer though, shame had to buy different chargers too, very good head phones and speakers tbf Bixby was very poor Google one so much better can actually understand your voice , not convinced the sides of screen help often press things accidently when holding the phone though it looks very nice",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Finally decided to switch from iphone as i think they are becoming less progressive and caught up in the brand they created.

galaxy,2,"I bought this a week ago and it's the same as my S7, just works a little faster and the battery lasts longer. There's a few little gadgets that are extras but make no difference to the phone whatsoever. I've not noticed or used any of the new features. The hardest thing to so was get used to the fingerprint sensor being on the rear. great phone, but that's because it's just a faster S7.

galaxy,5,"Amazing phone.Amazing photo quality,so light and clear screen...",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Have had the Galaxy S9 now for two weeks and am really impressed with the layout and functionality. I had the S6 Edge version which I thought was good but this phone can do so much more which I am still discovering. Photo are much sharper and easy to use. However battery life could be better as I feel I am charging everyday where as before it was very couple of days. Saying that if you want the phone to provide better functions then you can live with charging it a bit more.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I've had phone a week now and so far really impressed with the ease of navigating around the apps,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I bought the S9+ on contract as an upgrade from the Note4, couldnt believe how simple it was to transfer everything to the new phone.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,2,"I’ve recently upgraded from the S8 Plus to the S9 Plus and yes there are some little new features and bixby loads up a lot quicker, but who really uses bixby that much? The speaker is louder and more clearer but the battery’s are both the same and I find that my S9 battery is going down a lot quicker. Save your money, wait for the S10. Dont fall for the same mistake as me unless you really want a louder speaker and bixby to load up faster.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,I'm so glad I got a better phone and getting on with this do well,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Graphics and design incredible Would recommend to anyone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,"Prefered my old S6. The only good thing about the S9 is the battery life and the ability to do slow motion video. I would have thought by now we could have more colourful backgrounds like Android Jellybean did. I was disappointed with the Nougat on my S6 and thought that Oreo would be a welcome change, but there's not much difference that I can see. It's still plain, boring and white and becoming more and more like an iPhone, which I hate. Features I expected to still be here are the ability to insert our own text backgrounds and callouts, but all we have is a boring white background for contacts, texts, settings screen etc. Another annoying thing is that when having a conversation via speakerphone, the screen goes black so I'm having to keep on pressing the power button to keep the screen on, this makes it harder when you also need to hang up the phone as it takes longer to end the call and by the time you press the power button to display the screen, the other person hangs up instead. I hate how the home button is now part of the screen. Preferred having a real button to press, much more responsive.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Love it beter than my s6 so much faster also take much photos a cant ask for much beter but u allway make them beter every year thanx,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,I was told it had a better battery than predessesors but the battery life is poor! Half a day at best,Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"My old Sony handset was 3 years old and although it hadn't actually let me down I was ready for a change. My provider didn't offer a decent level Sony so I had to think about another brand, I've avoided Apple so had to choose something else. After a lot of deliberation I decided to go for the S9, I'm new to Samsung but so far I'm not dissapointed. It's early days and the handset is excellent, the only thing I miss is the ability to use music notifications for text messages, this is available for receiving phone calls.",Very.co.uk

I googled the issue and discovered that unless i go to a ""samsung certified"" repair shop there's nothing i can do about it except use headphones with a hands free mic!! The whole reason i got this phone was because after not even two years my S7 edge completely crashed on me. I loved my S7 edge, as i love most features on this S9+ but i wantdd a PHONE, not a small tablet. Now i'm stuck with a payment plan for a phone that i can't use as a phone!!",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,So far I have enjoyed the phone it feels good in the hand and has a good weight. The battery life and charge times are great. Is fast enough but my main issue is the Bixby button it is horrible I hate it I use it never it should be optional to change the purpose like a pause for music when headphones are in or to open a app of your choosing why does my phone listen when it's not in use there should be a easy way to turn that off it's a privacy concern to say the least would also assume it has a negative affect on battery life.the phones are to easy to hack but all androids have this problem,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"i upgraded from iPhone to samsung S9 about 2 or 3 weeks ago and i am so happy with my new phone! the best part is that it was so unbelievably easy to transfer all my photos, messages and contacts from one phone to the S9! the features are amazing and its so easy to use. i really love it! the photos i uploaded really don't do it justice (because it was taken on the webcam haha). the screen is beautiful, the whole design is flawless. i have chosen the pink samsung case to protect my phone however i wish it covered the whole edge of the device as i have a tiny scratch on the bottom near the charger port. the battery lasts ages i charge my phone once a day, and that isn't even on battery saving modes. if i had battery saver on my phone would last more then two days. plus you can optimise the device to free storage and battery. another trick is you can schedule a time to restart the phone automatically, to increase battery longevity. i have mine scheduled for tuesday at 3am while i am asleep so it does not disturb me. the features are so clever and i love how you can personalise the phone to your own preference. the camera is incredible and the sound quality is so clear, but with the dolby amos speakers it really is special. love that there is a headphone jack and a charger port.",Very.co.uk

When i moved to the S4 I was overjoyed with the improvements made to the line............ I was a little concerned coming from the S4 to the S9 but any personal dislikes I had of the newer design for example the Unibody and the no physical home button were quickly quelled within the first day of using. The screen was the main reason i went for the S9 in the end and WOW what a beautiful screen it is indeed. Very clear with gorgeous deep blacks and sumtious colours.............. but it was a difficult toss up between the Huawei P20 pro, the OnePlus 6T as alternatives. The camera way outperformed my expectaitions and the speakers..........wow, that was an amazing surprise to say the least. Overall I would have to say I am extremely happy with my new mobile and hope to have a great experience for the next few years. Top job Samsung :)",Very.co.uk

But i dont like that when using spotify it doesnt appear on the homescreen as it did on my s6 edge for example when listening to podcasts i am unable to skip 15 seconds from the lock screen also whenever i pause it it dissapears which is kknd of a nightmare. I do prefer having a physical home button and back button that i can press. This phone is very pretty though i love how easy it is to use. The camera is great the only problem is it zooms in too much when you havent even used the zoom feature. My face appears a lot closer than it is and i prefer my face to be a lot further. The apps and software are amazing but i would love to have a screen record feature as apps have to be downloaded in order to save some videos which isnt ideal. But i love samsung phones and this one is great.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,"Had the s8 before this, very little upgrades for the s9, camera doesn't match competitors, battery is still poor, design is identical, still has annoying things such as bixby",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I am very pleased with this phone. Great design and I love all of the features of it.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I love the way the fingerprint scanner can link to and secure apps from being accessed unless it's me and also the iris scanner,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had a couple of weeks & no faults found at all with the phone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Bought a few weeks ago and I love the master piece.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I'm a new owner of S9 plus and I jumped from Apple after 6 years and I have to say that it's worth it absolutely 200 %!!! You can do almost everything!! Good job guys there in Samsung! Keep going!!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Because i was looking for a new phone and thank you for helping me out .,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Had it a couple of weeks now and seem to learn something else most days.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I got this phone a week ago and I love it! It's easy to use, stylish and I love the new lilac colour! The camera is fantastic and the size and quality of the display screen are another excellent feature. Finally, the battery life is excellent.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"I bought this phone last week!! Brilliant, though miss the fingerprint scanner at the front and only seems to recognise my face whennive my make up on lol!! .. lovely design and camera is amazing",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,i really didnt expect much more after having a s5 neo except for faster speed. samsung s9 does fulfil that . But the phone is slim and elegant.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,it's very good and I'm happy with my s9+ keep it up,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Upgraded from an s6 and so happy I did! I really love it, bar the bixby button (which can be partially disabled) lol! Beautiful coral blue colour and amazing camera, responsive display and trustworthy battery life.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Decent but the Bixby button has let the phone down. Everytime I press the lock I end up pressing the Bixby button too and personally I find Bixby rubbish. if Samsung didn't have that feature it would be 5*,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Upgraded and I am super happy. The S9 feels great to use and layout is easy to get to grips with,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,Bought this after having an s7 for 2 yrs wish I hadn't bothered. Dropped it and smashed the glass back within 3 days! Stupid prices to fix. Save your money and but something more able to deal with a soft blow,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Had for 2 weeks. Always had Samsung, best one yet. Every detail is spot on.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I have just moved from the google pixel xl phone but I'm impressed with the galaxy s9, its sleek and fast with a superb camera",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Lovely phone, pleased with it so far. Battery life not great though, for a phone only a week old.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Just up grade from s7 to a s9 ! Wish it was more singing and dancing but it is not. Has a better camera and a bit faster .i would recommend,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"This is my first smartphone (I've used a Samsung c3050 until now) and I can't understand why they would make a phone with anything out of reach of the thumb - even when the screen is reduced to one handed mode it's too talk to reach with the thumb. I would also like to see a predictive text t9 keyboard available like my 'non' smart phone had! The qwerty is far too fussy. The addition of a suggested emoji feature to said keyboard would be invaluable. Bixby keeps appearing when I press things by mistake which is very irritating as I have no need for a virtual ai assistant. The smartview feature in the gallery is impossible to access in order to change the settings on it. Other than that, the phone is fine.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,The S9 features and Performance are brilliant however the issue is with the design of the phone the phone is very slippery to hold only had a few days before dropped and damaged the frame and cracked the glass Needs to come with a case protector or improve the grip on the actual phone. Therefore not so happy as I have a phone less than a month old already damaged the phone case I have now 100% better on grip,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"I got the S9 as a upgrade from my S7 edge, now as an upgrade i thought i would get all my old features plus any new features, yes? no. I have everything EE including EETV and used to love flipping through the channels on my phone and then with a swipe of the screen change channels. I could not get this to work on my new phone when asked why i was told the S9 does not support this app. so i got a downgrade not up.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Im really happy overall, but carrying this phone in my pocket left few scratches within a week and screen replacement is way too expensive. I'm forced to pack such a nice phone in bulky and sturdy case.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Bought last week it's great phone it's one hand dvice.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I got this phone 2 weeks ago and I'm very happy with it,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Iv had many samsung phones, but this one is the bees knees i love it",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Slick and stylish and has a great camera. Do not care for Bixby but that is the only thing. J used to love upday but cant seem to figure out how to get it working....I've just got Bixby, why should I care about Bixby! People to some degree like too doing things our self. People think they like everything done for them but they really don't, well not everything anyway. The tech is either not there yet or just not configured but right now Bixby is just annoying and in the way! Everything else about the phone is fantastic. Love samsung",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Bought one month before and running smoothly . Pride to be as the owner of galaxy S9,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Only had this phone for a short time previously had an S8 which I rate but the S9 is definitely an improvement. I find the biggest improvements are the speakers and the camera. like I said only had the phone for a short time but had no problems with it as yet.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Can't recommended this phone enough 10/10 all round,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Love the performance and speed pretty happy so far but.... what's with the bixby button being opposite the unlock button. Inevitably it gets pushed nearly every time I unlock my phone...

galaxy,5,Long battery life So many things to do on it Big screen to watch movies and play games,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I bought this phone on Black Friday and was really pleased with the easy set up of the device, everything from my old S7 was transferred to my S9 quickly and it looked identical, even the layout of the apps was the same. Bixby is good fun, but apart from that, I don't see a huge difference in the phone.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Only had my phone a few days, but love finding new fearures , esp Ar emoji.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Bought to replace s7 , typing can be a bit staccato and got a recurring voicemail notifications that won't go away. Like the camera but the typing is a pain.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I upgraded my S8+ to an S9+ recently, the functionality is almost identical to the S8+ so there was a reassuring familiarity to it. The biggest difference I have found is the battery life has improved by around 25%, which for me is a godsend.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"I like the phone, as I did the 7 Edge I had previously but I miss my news updates on the left-of-home page screen; I don't particularly want Bixby but can't get rid of it. It seems to be trying to move me further into areas I don't particularly want to go (Samsing Pay, etc) but perhaps I'm not the target audience for this 'phone (too old ?)",Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,Not at easy at its made out to transfer onto the new phone and biometric not brilliant,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I have had it for a while and still discovering what it or I can do with it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Had this a week and really like many of the features. However, I don't like the Bixby button placed on the same level as the Power button. When operated in one hand mode, invariably Bixby pops up when I press the power off button. A bit annoying! I have been unable to set up Cloud Print so far, despite all my printers showing as being registered in Google. I'm expecting a callback later, in the hope that this can be resolved. Overall, a really nice phone with plenty of features.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,So much improvement with feel and design since I bought my S6.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,The s9 is brilliant best phone out there in my eyes perfect,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Only had the S9 for a week but I already love it 5*,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I'm happy for my Samsung s9.............. .....,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Touch response is amazing and the size of the phone is ideal. Best phone I've had.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I went off Samsung Mobile; I then went into-iphones after that; their phones become very similar- so when I went back to Samsung, recently-I've seen the difference with this Samsung Galaxy S9.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I've always had apples and recently switched...will never be switching back!!!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Bought my S9 recently upgraded from my S6 which I adored. Like new clothes things take time to ease into a comfortable feeling, this S9 is taking it's time to endear to me. The clarity of the screen is exceptional and the smart phone upgrades compared to my old faithful S6 are obviously noticeable, speed is a clear winner here. However my main gripe is the fingerprint biometric scanner placement, long fingers and large palm people no problem for you but it's still the most awkward thing to use, so you guessed it I use the password code instead, which really defeats one of this machines key features. So try before you buy not everyone will be comfortable with the fingerprint scanner placement.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I had an old galaxy A5 This new phone is amazing I'm really enjoying it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Not disappointed one bit. All the new features are great,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"When I bought my phone two weeks ago I had a few teething problems setting it up the way I wanted it. There was messages popping up to do with MESSAGES and MESSANGER. I had to answer yes to be able to write my message which then led to two lots of the same message being sent. I also had a problem setting up notification repeat when I missed a call or message. I manages to get this sorted out by going through YouTube and the phone is great. I found that the places on the phone to do the things that I want are not easy to find unless you get help online. Other than that, the phone is great. The battery life is no better than my Samsung galaxy S7.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Upgrading from my Galaxy S5 to the S9 was a little daunting after 4 years usage but I needn't have worried. I soon found my way around the new handset as there are sufficient similarities but with great improvements.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Bought it a week a go and being an old iPhone user I'm really happy with my choice. Good job guys,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Its a good phone really quick has a great display but since one of the most expensive phone i was expecting to have a long lasting battery and its own music player created by Samsung. The only way this phone lasts a day if i user power saving its a shame my Sony Xperia XA is 200-300 pound worth of phone and it beats S9 in speed and battery also in camera.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,"The alarm is not working correctly, I am taking my phone back to the shop today in the hope they can fix the problem......if not I will be expecting a new replacement as a phone without a working alarm is useless to me!!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I would recommend this phone to all my colleagues and Family,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,The screen is brilliant for the btsport app but not too big to fit in your pocket.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Mostly happy with it but a couple of very disappointing backward changes in my opinion. I like to set individual message notifications so that I know if it is one of my family if I'm driving and can't read it to check. Also miss 'swype' keyboard.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,My only complaint of the S9 is that due to the curved edges it is difficult to get the keys to work properly ie 1 q a 0 p l the back space key and the send key on messges. You have to try many times to make them work. Other than that I love it.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I just switched from an iPhone 5s to galaxy s9 and it's gorgeous! It works amazing- not laggy like my iPhone. It's so nice to not have to worry about storage or have to deal with annoying iCloud pop ups (or, y'know, icloud). There's been a small bit of difficulty transferring data from my old phone to this one but I think that's mostly my old phone's fault because it was dodgy syncing with anything and there's nothing I really miss apart from a few numbers and photos which I emailed over anyway. I adore google apps like slides, docs and drive (which have already saved my butt twice in two weeks). The phone itself is gorgeous and so nice to use, it was easy to switch from iOS and the edge screen is beautiful and functional! I was vaguely concerned about going to a bigger phone because I have tiny hands and the iPhone 5s fit my hands perfectly but this is so much easier than I thought and the one handed mode just makes it that small bit easier. Screen protectors are difficult and I've found one that isn't perfect but I can deal and the extra sensitivity setting in advanced features helps a lot. Wireless charging is such a lifesaver I've never encountered and I'm wondering how I dealt without! Definitely recommend!!!",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I found this phone had more atributes than my old S7,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I purchased an S9 as a replacement for my 3 year old S6. There was nothing wrong with the S6, I just wanted an update. The S9 is light and the screen is wonderfully sensitive and tactile. The 'new' USB-C cable is a vast improvement in the Micro USB that was so fiddly and had to be inserted the right way up, although this change has meant needing to change all my cables and accessories - an expense I had not budgeted for. Transferring my data and setting up was simple, although some specifics needed to be sorted manually - ie individual contact ringtones. The S9 has all the bells and whistles you could possibly need - and more you don't; ie AR Emojis! I really can't see where mobiles can go from here, but then tech is moving at a fast rate so you never know.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,"I bought the s9 a couple weeks ago. Generally speaking it's a good phone and im sure in time I'll find it more usefully but for now: Bixby is annoying and doesn't really understand what I'm saying. I don't like the fact that there is a dedicated button to it. Keep pressing it by accident! Samsung Pay won't let me register because cards by Barclays aren't supported. Because I have come from using an s6 for four years I'm still getting used to there not being an actual home key and that all the buttons are now touch. Another problem I'm having is that some of the notification sounds for text seem to go off 7 times in a row, rather than just once! Features I am liking are the speed of the phone, the different camera options which can be fun, the selfie mode is also fun. I also like the quality of the video.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Overall I'm happy with the phone however I am worried it may have faults already within a week as the earphones provided with the phone is scratchy sometimes when listening to music and the phone has turned off by itself already.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,"Ive had this phone a week and although there are some great features, overall Im quite dissapointed in it.

galaxy,5,I changed from a Galaxy 6 to the 9 and it is so much better.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"My previous phone the J5 was an excellent phone, difficult decision to change. The S9 is a step up especially in terms of the camera. I am very pleased with the S9 and I look forward to travelling and taking photos but is it worth twice as much as the J5? Maybe not.

galaxy,5,This was my upgrade from 3 and its the best phone I've had yet! It does everything but make the tea. I think Bixby does need to do more like i should be able to ask her to play music from Spotify,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Moved over from iPhone SE on upgrade and so far very happy with the change - don't find it as intuitive as iOS but it is just a case of being different.

The only thing that annoys me is the bundled software you can't get rid off. They know people will swap the messaging and call apps etc so why not just let them uninstall it. Other than that. Great phone. Fast, great screen, looks great and awesome camera.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Only had this phone a week..great so far, glad i chose it",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Bought a few months ago, great all round phone,good design.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Only had the phone a week but so pleased so far. Stylish, sleek and so up to date. Not used the new box by as yet and some.oftge features are beyond my capabilities at the minute, I may have been more aware had U not jumped from s7 to s9 as the s8 may have had more of these features. All round very pleased.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I got this last week and so far I like it but the bixby button is a bit irritating as I press it by accident all the time,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I've always loved Samsung phones they have easy buttons to work with,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Very happy with this phone. I run a furnishing business so being able to capture professional looking images on the run is invaluable.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,Its thd worst sAMsung i have ever had. Big big regret !,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Bought it a werk ago and i do like it would recomend it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"After 6 weeks of ownership I am converted! Love my S9, it's obviously taken me a few weeks to get to grips with the operating system switch but no regrets! Slick operation, amazing camera, flexible (love the fact I just popped a 200gb micro SD in for more storage). The screen is also AMAZING! Would definitely recommend!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I can safely say that after using the Galaxy S9 for 10 minutes, I instantly fell in love with it. The device has the greatest design I have yet to see in a smartphone. The Super AMOLED Infinity display is spectacular. Along with the superb, rich sounding and clear audio from the dual stereo speakers, I am able to watch videos and movies in breathtaking quality. The device operates smoothly, especially when taking on tasks such as browsing the web and social media. The camera is also faultless, with the ability to take amazing low light photos- thanks to dual aperture. The 960fps super slow motion feature on the camera is also outstanding and fun to play around with. Overall I am very impressed, and I am very proud to own this phenomenal device. Thank you Samsung!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"It's fast, has a good battery life and the camera is really good",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Bought the phone three months ago great phone especially for me,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Did the move from Apple to Android. Im Impressed. The s9 Is an amazing phone and has all the features you'd expect from a flagship. But at a better price. The only downfall to this phone is the stubborn samsung apps. For example I can't remove the photo app and replace it for google photos. So I have two apps going. (I know first world problems) but it would be great to have more options. Also Bixby is hilariously bad. Particularly once you compare it to google assist. I wish i cpuls just conpletly delete it frok my phone. Don't be Apple samsung and let us change our phone how we want. But overall amazing phone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Upgraded to the S9 and yes it has a similar feel and look but it hasn't paused in development. Simple tweaks have improved what was an amazing phobe. The speed, the finger print sensor, the camera tweeks make a host of difference. Love Samsung, and connected to my Samsung Watch and 360 it's a perfect partner.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Great phone with plenty of features. Just learning all the features from YouTube at moment. Always used Samsung, greatly recommend the s9",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I bought this phone as I had an accident with my Nokia 8, what a better phone! Count ask for a better device so pleased.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I've had this a month and it is by far the best phone I've ever owned. I've been with Apple and Sony for the last few years but fancied a change and the S9 suits me perfectly. Great functionality, great camera, easy to use from the moment you pick it up. Battery could be better but I'm probably not using it very efficiently as I rarely close apps and the kids always get hold of it and watch videos and take pics. Overall great phone .",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Best Samsung yet. Love all the features although google seems to understand voice commands better than Bixby.,Very.co.uk

I love the phone, however I am slightly disappointed with the battery life. Having upgraded from the S7 Edge to the S9, I expected a big jump in battery life, and less charging needed, but alas the difference is smaller than I'd hoped.

galaxy,2,"I had the Samsung s7 before this phone, and it is a big step up! Camera, screen display, and battery life are so much better. The only downside is the talk to Bixby feature - it is Americanized language so doesn't understand British words like 'mum' and it doesn't always pick up my voice well. However I'm sure this will get improved as it's a new feature I think.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Amazing features and overall fantastic. Camera takes great pictures. Way better than my old iphone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,I have swapped this phone once so has my partner. On loud speaker to one another its unworkable to the point i could smash the thing. If an apple caller calls me its fine tbough. Camera is ok android is good but i will be back to an iphone soon as my contract is done.,Very.co.uk

The phone itself seems quick, even with many apps open. I haven't tried all of the features yet as haven't had the time, but I have no regrets at all. On my thing I need to adjust to is the bixby key as is so close to volume keys, I get frustrated with that sometimes but bar that 10/10",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I upgraded from s8 to s9 due to provider giving me a great deal, was waiting until next year for the 10 or newer. Didn't think there would be much difference, as I loved my s8.

galaxy,3,Great phone but battery is awful. Lucky to last half a day,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I upgraded from an iPhone to this Samsung having preferred Samsung in the past and I have no regrets whatsoever. The phone is unbelievably quick, user friendly and an amazing HD screen and camera",Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,"I bought this a few weeks ago because my s4 was getting old, but I really miss some of the old ring tones like the ""Chirps"" for messages... I am a bird lover, so that is important for me.

galaxy,5,"Only recently purchased the s9 and it's by far one if the best phones. Besides the great music quality, the camera is by far the best feature and the size of the phone isn't too big either.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"My wife has the s8 and I've always liked the very clear screen among all the other attributes so I got the s9 on a cheap deal because the s10 will be out soon. Highly recommend this phone, so easy to use, just buy one....",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"This S9 replaced my S3 which was still working perfectly after over five years. Of course, the screen and camera are noticeably better, it is faster on 4G than 3G, and the processor is noticeably faster as well as having really useful new features such as face and fingerprint recognition. Surprisingly, the predictive text does not seem to be quite as good - it does not make a single i into a capital I and I have to manually add a space after a comma.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had for 1 month. Does everything I want and probably more than I will ever need!,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,Had my phone a little over 2 weeks. Like it so far except for Bixby and the annoying button. I also unfortunately do not like the move to a usbc connector when the accessories all use usb mini connectors. Easy to use and sturdy. Still struggling with all the preloaded Samsung apps and that it pushes you to use Samsung pay. The whole point of Android is so you get app choice not so you are pushed down a brand. My review would be higher if it were not for bixby and all the annoying samsung apps.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,I don't use any of the assistant apps whether it is Google assistant or Siri. Why force Bixby upon us with a dedicated button that is awkwardly placed under the volume button. I wish I had done more research before choosing my upgrade phone this year... I have used Samsung phones for many years and have had no issues until now. I honestly regret choosing Samsung this year purely because of this extra button.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I loved my New Samsung s9. Great features. Lovely handset,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I was so glad that this phone is waterproof. I accidentally flooded my kitchen a few days after I got this phone and had to use it to call for assistance. Knowing that holding it in wet hands and seeing it being splashed with (clean) water wasn't as worrying as it would have been had I purchased a phone which wasn't Samsung. (By the way - it was perfectly fine),Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I've had my S9 for a week after swapping my iPhone 8 plus.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Yet another super phone that does everything I need. I've had the S3, S5, S7 and now S9. The main issues I have is that they seem to be ever more complex. In other words the technology has now gone 'over-the-top'. It seems so easy to make a mistake. Samsung also keep adding unwanted apps which cannot be removed. And I don't like texting or editing photo's when the app tries to do it for you. Rather than making it simpler, it is more confusing. Examples: If I make a spelling mistake I want to correct it myself and not be bombarded with many options. But its still a great phone.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"I got this phone on contract with Voafone. Has taken a while to get use to it. Lots of unnecessary features. Lots of pages for this that and the other. Having no button to press at the bottom had made going back difficult. Not always clear what I have to press resulting in loss of web page.

There are a select few other phones that may have a better feature, such as improved camera, but the S9 offers a very solid all-round good package.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"Good phone but can't remove Bixby which I don't want but opens anyway. Constantly asked to register my personal details which I don't need or want to do. All else similar to my S7 which was great. Just stop trying to harvest my data with samsung account and bixby, I spent a lot on a premium phone and don't expect to be forced by irritation to give my data as well. I won't get a Samsung next time if they keep this up.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,This is a very good phone a better upgrade than the s6 I had only down side is the bixby button near the volume button when I try to turn volume down I catch it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"This phone is amazing, theres is just one problem, snapchat, that camera doesn't work properly via the app what it does or takes a screen grab rather then a photo meaning the quality is terrible hence everyone thinks Samsung's are bad... just a tip, fix your problem with them worlds most used app and you will sell more phones, it's simple",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Fantastic phone loving it fantastic design slim and easy to use,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"Moved to Samsung 9 from iPhone and like the large memory. Obviously trying to get used to navigation of the phone so still getting used to it all. Like external memory. Bad points, to hard to grip solidly without a case. A button dedicated to Bixby.... what is this app and what if I don't want it. And the screen capture is poor as it is done via volume and on button and is really not easy to use. Overall, phone is ok, not that impressed with camera either.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I've now owned the s9 for a couple of weeks after upgrading from my s7 edge. Setting it up was simple and using it is much the same as other Samsung smart phones/tablets except extremely quick at everything. The iris scanner works almost every occasion the only time it may not work is in the evening when there is a light behind me shining onto the screen.my only gripe would be this all glass design although it looks great its so slippery and feels fragile (I did smash my s7 edge dropping it once in a case) I wouldn't dream of having this phone without some sort of protection for it.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,To be honest I preferred my s7 edge phone. Don't feel the s9 has much more to offer. Think I would have just kept old phone knowing what s9 was like,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Good phone and excellent camera. A few too many apps that run i the background and drain the battery unless they are turned off otherwise a great mobile device.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Had this phone a month. I chose it as I was getting fed up with apple. I find the operating system quite complicated, bit like having more control over features. My family have apple, so I need to figure out a good way to find my or their phones, quite a hand feature to find the kids!

galaxy,4,Not really totally happy with the phone as several apps can't get any notifications of any sort only vibration which is only good if your holding the phone .

galaxy,4,"Have only had the phone around a week so still learning all it has to offer but so far loving the fast charge cable-very useful! Photos are good quality and I love the screen-the larger size , compared to my old phone, is fab. Am having trouble sending emails but this may be a network problem rather than handset.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I bought this a month ago and this fone performs well nice work samsung,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Very good phone, very easy to use, just as good as iPhone. Only reason for a4 start and not a 5 is cause i find it difficult to take a selfie using the lock and volume button, it either locks it or turns it down lol unless I'm doing it wrong because I haven't had it long. Other than that minor little fault is an excellent phone.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,2,"I Don't really like this phone, it is not for me at all",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Not really fussed by phones but this reallyi s a step up from previous devices I have had by a company that sounds like fony. Smooth looking, great performance, even though I have loaded it with music doesnt lag or slow. Charges quickly which is imoortant for busy people . You can tell its a powerful bit of kit. Samsung for the win as the company who sell phones that rhyme with ""cyclone"" make them too delicate . Again great but of kit cannot fault it. Keep up the good work. I like the way most Samsung devices all work together like my smart tv for instance.",Very.co.uk

After using Apple I Phones from the 3G/3GS onwards my first move to Android was with this phone, from the seamless transfer, the S9 has been a pleasure to use, ultra fast with a stella screen !

galaxy,5,"It took me over a month to convince myself to try the S9. I have always been an iPhone girl so switching to Samsung made me dubious. However, I am glad I made the switch! Not only does the battery last a lot longer than iPhone but you get pretty much the same apps and books ect. The only issue I have found when doing the switch is that there is no app to take my old books from my iPhone over to the s9 and my bank does not support google pay.

Other than that, great.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I love this phone. It has a fantastic camera and the biometric unlocking is great. I prefer the fingerprint scanner being on the back, as it is really handy when using it to unlock things such as my bank acount. The screen is fantastic also. I still have to check out many other features. One weak apsect, though, is Bixby. IOt is not good and does not understand my accent. Google assistant is far better.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,2,"The s9 has barely changed since the s7. A few new features.... the newest detail being that the phone is slowwww.... all apps start up extra slow and delayed. It has glitches... my s9 is brand new and the slowest smart phobe I've ever had. My s7 edge was faster and ran smoother at 2 years old, with a severely cracked screen and my memory always pushing the edge of it's limit. Is this Bixby thing really anything special. I haven't bothered with it.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,It's got everything I ever want from a Samsung and more!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I'm not a phone boffin!! I have yet to identify any mega improvements over my S7. However I do regard my new S9 as a cost effective upgrade given the generous deal on my old phone and the interest free loan from Paypal.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I upgraded and I'm glad I chose this phone instead of an iphone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,I have had this phone for around 6 weeks. The screen is already scratched!!!! I have had Samsung phones for many years and have never experienced this! I am so sad that it could cost me hundreds of pounds to get this repaired.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"I've had the phone roughly a month, my previous phone was an s8, purchased due to poor battery life on the s8, the main difference is the fingerprint sensor. Any other differences are software based, these maybe due to updates on the software, and battery life is still the same, not worth adding a photo, as many can be found on search engines.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I dont like the way the back button, or stop button works. Because its push twice. Not used bixey yet. The finger scanner made me reset my phone. But I aint a geek. So ask me in a month after ive used it more.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Excellent phone got it two months ago on EE contract.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Not had a new phone for 4 years. My last phone was a S4 so you can imagine how the S9 feels to me. Very sensitive touch screen.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"I received my handset a little over a week ago. Although the phone has a lot of great features I am very sorry to say I wasn't blown away by it, It may just be the case that I have to get used to it but I found it wasn't much better than my S6. That said, the basic features are fantastic quality - the camera is awesome, the screen is extremely clear and the sound quality is amazing.

galaxy,1,Most of the apps are the same but the screen is weaker but a long shot had it 3 days in a spidgen case (that my s8 lasted 2 years in without any breaks) and screen smashed! Waste of time and money,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,The phone is excellent easy to navigate I would highly recommend.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Upgraded from S7 edge to this S9+ due to end of contract ..all good except for the return button just hate it..keep pressing by mistake..so annoying. Also awkward trying to take screenshot with this phone, perhaps there is a different way? Overall good clear sharp sound when making calls, very clear.. If I had to choose from the three mobiles I've had over the last 4 years for camera and pictures I would pick the Samsung galaxy note 3 every time . Love the photos on note 3 more natural than on this phone and the S7 edge.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Best phone to have at the moment....super slow motion on the camera is excellent...so many new features on the s9.....nothing else compares to it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Best phone ive ever had. Wouldnt rate bixby though!!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Previously on the iPhone 6, was considering the iPhone 8 until the S9 came down in price in anticipation of the new galaxy being released. Couldn't be happier, incredible phone with very attractive design, made perfect when combined with Mous case.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Had this phone a week now and still finding great gadgets and just really love it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Always have a Samsung phone, and they are always improving",Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,"Had an iPhone for years but decided to make the change to Samsung recently as the iPhone was too expensive and I was getting fed up of it getting slower after a year. The Samsung is OK.... it's not as easy to use, the Bixby feature isn't great and the button on the side of it is so annoying - always accidentally pressing it. the texting keyboard is really slow. The predictive text is rubbish. The front camera is worst that the iPhone. A few apps like FitBit and Instagram always have problems now (fitbit never syncs and instagram stories cut off around the screen?). Overall, the back camera is the only good thing about it. I wish I stuck to my iPhone.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Slow motion has to be filmed in VERY light conditions. If you use auto mode filming or taking pictures in low light you're still going to get noise/grain.. in contrast during daylight the camera is flawless i believe you cannot get a better camera on a phone but yet again zooming in can be a issue,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Positives Very responsive, camera good, user friendly interface",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Cool features on this phone does a lot more than expected,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"From an iPhone to a Samsung I can definitely see the differences in the UX a more complex and enjoyable device. The processor of the Samsung and general running ability give it a clear unique definition. Small tweaks can be made to the interfaces to be more user friendly and attract other audiences. Needs more compatibility to top used apps e. G swiping ability, one hand use of apps. Good phone definitely converted!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Absolutely amazing phone , I swap from Apple and just one regret why I haven't done this early lol . Thanks",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Loving the extra features over my old S7. Worth the wait!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought this last week and am glad I decided to make the switch from ios. One issue I do have with the phone however is the dedicated bixby button is inconvieniently placed below the volume down button. If there was another place to put this button to prevent accidental pressing that would be fantastic.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,got on contract love the phone not got to grips with Bixby and I would of preferred the Bixby button on the lock side,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Think nearly everything about the phone is great, feels good easy to use great camera.. my only downfall is using the new emogis in messages cost me 50p everytime which i wasnt aware of.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I have had this phone about a week. It's great,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Have had it for couple of weeks and loving it easy to use and camera is brilliant,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I have been an iPhone customer for the last 7 years, I have had enough of apple and decided to make the switch. I have not been disappointed with the S9, its a really great phone. There are certainly more pros than cons, I just find that in terms of ease of use the iPhone wins for its simplicity whereas these are small computers and as such have to operate it like a computer. For me I wish there was a simpler layout, it's feels too much is going on at one time. Plus I have been extremely disappointed with the battery life.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I've only had this phone for about 2 weeks now and can honestly say it's already miles better than an iPhone. I've always had iPhones, but sick of the extreme price hikes and method in which Apple admitted slowing them down over time, so I swapped to android and couldn't be happier. Only thing I wish I'd done was actually physically seeing the s9. This is because I probably would have got the s9+ instead, but now I've bought a new case and just got the settings to my taste, I can't be bothered to change it again lol.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,It's a week today I got my phone and I can't put my phone down. Thank You Samsung best ever Samsung,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Really good phone great features love the camera Love the phone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I am so happy I changed from iPhone to Samsung it's a brill phone and camera,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Bought my phone two weeks ago and I'm so glad I did! I upgrade every 3 years and I was very excited to get the new S9 (in purple!). The phone's design looks and feels good and has adapted perfectly to my everyday life style. The battery lasts very well, at least two days of use currently! The camera quality is amazing, as Samsung always is. I was unsure of Bixby initially but it's a very handy feature when you are on the go and need something done quick. Alongside this, the phone speed is brilliant and is quick to respond. The phone itself isn't cheap and you are paying the ""Galaxy"" range price, but I do feel you get what you pay for when it comes to Samsung. It took a few days adjusting to the new fingerprint reader but I'm definitely in the swing now. The response is much improved compared to my previous model. I fully recommend the S9 to anyone who is willing, or considering, taking the leap.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Bought 2 weeks ago. Really impressed with style, apps, easy to use and smart.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I got this on contract a month ago and i can't be happier. Samsung have thought out a lot on this phone. Was always an iPhone guy now I am duffo a samsung guy.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Wish Samsung would make a phone that can last a whole day. Usually have to charge my S9+ at least once,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Best phone I ever owned. Great features, smart design and quality built.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Had to replace my Windows phone (Lumia 930) which I was gutted about. But since I've had my Galaxy S9, I've never looked back! I love this phone.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I love my new galaxy s9 so modern and lots of handy things to make life easier,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Best phone I've owned, even compared to the fruit competition. Slick, easy, high res screen, great for cheap VR, camera, storage, I mean what more can a phone do? Just get one.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,Had all the Samsung's and I must say I'm disappointed in this as not really any changes from s8 plus,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,i have had this phone 3 weeks now and its slow always coming up that there is faults not impressed at all. the look of it and how it feels is great but the technology is faulty most of the time.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I bought s9 this month, I like dual sim feature its proven very useful but the fact that I cant register any of my credit cards with samsung pay it annoying, Also the fact that samsung health doesn't work with vitality is another feature im missing here",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Best phone I've ever had and the price is an absolute steal, anything you want to do, you can, it's absolutely amazing, my one point would be barclays doesn't work on samsung or google pay so better start remembering your wallet!",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I bought this about 2 weeks ago and am now getting to grips with the great features.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"The screen bends around the edges of the phone, not only does this distort the image but leads to a lot of miss clicks.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,I have had this phone since May. I have noticed that the phone has started to heat up from the back. There is no favourite on phone contacts. It is very similar to the the previous Samsung 5 and 6.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I was an iPhone user. I know. Quiet. But i had enough of the hardware issues and battery faults so I took the plunge and bought an S9. My main worry was the transfer from one phone to another. But this couldn't have been simpler. Simply plug one into the other with the adapter provided and it does it for you. Samsung for the win! And now I wonder why I had an iPhone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Camera is amazing compared to my previous phone would highly recommend!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I wish Samsung would ship a phone that has total ad blocking enabled by default. I am still trying to block ads and have wasted hours. Otherwise its great.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"It replaced my s8, not that it's worth updrading from s8 to s9, as it's almost the same phone , but as always Samsung delivery an amazing mobile, I'm 100% happy with it as usual",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I probably should have bought the 9+ for the larger screen.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Upgraded from apple to samsung. Very easy to use the only problem I find is that some apps in the top right and bottom corners don't respond to touch very well. I have to press on it whilst the other apps open with ease,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Thought I'd treat myself. Glad I did, great phone.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Upgraded from my galaxy s6 which still held up pretty well after 2 years. S9 is a major upgrade from the S6. It's much quicker, the battery life is better and the infinity display is without doubt the best screen on a smartphone. I haven't tested the camera to its fullest but so far it is fine, images do seem over exposed some times. Bixby is not a feature I use very often so have switched off the button command. Would be nice if the button could be remapped. But overall this phone is a great pick and I would highly recommend",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"The phone looks great but i s diffcult to handle because every time you touch the sides things you don't want to happen, happen! I try to activate the phone to answer a call and I get Bixby. I try to swipe between screens and I get all sorts of stuff I never wanted and can't seem to turn off. There are so many buttons on the side of the phone that I can't pick it up without turning off the volume or putting the phone into standby. I'm thinking of trading it in for a paper cup and some string. Or maybe a firelighter, some wet leaves and a blanket.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I bought this phone about a week ago, and I'm really please! Great features, good camera, and battery holds well.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I recently decided it was time for an upgrade from my J3 (quite a step up I know) but after buying this phone I was amazed on everything I had been missing out on. The Galaxy S9 is the perfect phone for everybody. It has an amazing camera, astounding battery life and brilliant performance.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Been using a Galaxy S5 for three years and very pleased. Getting the S9 was a massive step forward. A bit like being given a grown-up phone. Faster processing, sharper responses, smarter aps and all sorts of clever, nice, user friendly touches that keep surprising me. You couldn't wish for a better or more advance mobile. Pre-loaded with Samsung smart switch app so transferring everything from the old phone to this one was really easy and quick.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I love my new s9 but there is a few minor issues for me, I had the coral blue s7 edge before this phone and i could not fault the build quality of the s7 its an amazing looking phone with the gold bezel and it had a good wheight to it as well, nevertheless my s9 is amazing.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Moving up from an S7 to an S9 I wasn't sure how much better my new could be. I'm still getting used to it's many new fearures but very impressed so far.

galaxy,5,Got this phone two weeks ago and it is 10 X better than my old iPhone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I like Samsung galaxy phone, my wife says I am not allowed fruit bast phones",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Samsung have done amazing job with everything on this phone, battery life especially impressed me compared to my last phone. However, there is one space for improvement...Bixby. They should allow for the Bixby button to be linked to Google assistant if people want it because I'm sorry to say but Bixby is not great (yet) and Google assistant is amazing right now. That's it but overall good job Samsung!",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,recently bought and really love it. especially the photos,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,So much better than apple. Would recommend samsung everyday of the week. Amazing features and the camera is fantastic.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Phone generally good ..... but battery life disappointing.... the battery needs to be around 35% bigger to give user ability to use full power more often. Also too much pre loaded samsung software. Internal memory also needs to be increased to 6gb.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Upgraded from about S7 Edge and is all I expected but the battery life nowhere near as good. Needs charging every day and I'm not an excessive user either.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought the phone a week ago and loving it. So far so good. Has great features and great camera quality.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,I bought the S9 two weeks ago and as overall the phone is great. Nice performance and great features however I am extremelly dissapointed that the design is nearly 100 percent the same as the S8 one. However I love S8 and it is my favourite so far. The design is great and lovely but I was hoping S9 would be with different design.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,"I got this phone as a upgrade from a S7 edge which i likes alot to find that what can be done on the cheapest of samsung smart phones has now been removed and that customisation of the messages app, even your tecnical and samsung stars could not sort other then to say that i need to use a theme why when its only the messages app i want to change i have not found a single theme i like. Then you have removed the Video editing app so you can make a video on your phone third party apps can not compete with that app removing apps and settings to force people to use you app store is a old trick get the basic features back your loyal samsung fans have come to like and use my old S5 has these on this is very disapointing samsung also removing the feature to take a 360 degree photo is pathetic we not norare we going to buy a extra camera when the phone is more then capable",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"As a previous iPhone user, I wanted to see what see how a Samsung phone would compare and I managed to get a great deal on the s9. This phone just does everything well, I like the wide variety of says to securely unlock the phone and the camera is just in a whole different level from an iPhone. Battery life is one of the most important parts of a phone and the battery life on the s9 is good and it charges so quickly.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"Well after ten years of iPhone, after the new to expensive releases of th xs, I decided to give samsung a go.refused to pay over a grand for a phone so here I am. Had a few issues with crashing apps which was not what I needed the first time with a samsung but they seemed to fix themselves on updates, as an Apple user before, do i think this is better? Size yes, option for memory yes, just as fast, now I can now change themes and screen shot with a swipe of the hand, I would say apples software is slightly better but overall I'm glad I made the switch.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Upgraded to this phone about a month ago and I'm still constantly surprised about how efficient it is to use at all times of the day for literally so many different things. The Bixby feature is amazing, camera quality, samsung pay etc.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I really love the phone, had the s8 active in America and needed a new phone in the UK. The only things I don't like that I know of right now is the edge screen. Edge screens are not good for 1 handed use, you end up pushing all the stuff on the sides. The other thing that is bad is AR emoji... It assumes every woman has long hair and wears skirts... So if you are a woman who isn't in this category then expect to have to set up your emoji as a male :(",Very.co.uk

I upgraded from the s6, which I adored, but the battery used to drain after two years of use. The battery on this phone is great. The only issue I have with the phone is that most phones to not have a screen of similar size and viewing pictures of other phones can be annoying because it's cut off. Other than that I have found no issues and I'm really enjoying my new phone.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Battery life not lasting compared to other brand. Barely made through 1 day.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,"I bought the samsung galaxy s9 after my google pixel xl was due to upgrade, through it would be a better phone. But the battery doesn't last the day for me and I barely use it, also the front camera always ""perfects"" my face and adds makeup. The Bixby button is quite annoying and can drive me insane, as well as the retina scan never works or picks up my irises. Besides these points, there is no difference to the s8, you may as well pay less money for the s8.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,The phone is awesome and i love it. I am disappointing about battery power.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"The screen! Oh my lord how beautiful is that screen. I bought a refurbed iPhone X with a view to downgrading my contract to sim only when up for renewal. Renewal time came and I immediately upgraded to a sunrise gold S9. iPhone X is so lacking in comparison. Android is taking a bit of getting used to but the hardware so makes up for that. I cannot stop picking it up to look at that screen. The feel in the hand is lovely, so thin and narrow even though the screen is the same size as iPhone is feels much smaller. The reasons I haven't given it 5 stars is battery life could be better. Even though it isn't an issue it means the handset is not perfect. Also is the epic failure of Android Auto on my car (relied on CarPlay a lot), which I realise may be an app issue but could Samsung do something to help it run better in their device maybe?????? Would be lovely if all colours were released at launch and available to buy on Samsung website. I wouldn't particularly choose to buy the blue pink or black.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I've had this phone for two weeks and am well impressed. Had 2 Windows phones before this and the s9 blows them both out of the water. The apps had more features and are better to use with notifications and updates.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,"I am an apple user since 2014 and have been very happy with the product. This year I decided to take the chance and convert to something new, hence the s9 which I bought, June this year, via a contract with Vodafone.So far the camera is good, software is average and the battery....meeeeh. I have charged my phone to 100% before going to bed and when I woke up I was dismayed to see that it had consumed 3-5% of its energy overnight, eventhough I was not doing anything with it. It's kind of subpar compared to the battery performance of my iphone 6 before when it was still fully 100% when I wake up after charging it the night before. I've been using the phone for the last few months biu to tell you the truth the battery is really frustrating. Good thing I still have my spare phone to use together with the S9 otherwise I would not be able to last a day. I am really trying my best to make my S9 my daily driver but it just could not cope and battery drains really fast. I still have more than 1.5 years with the contract but I can't wait for it to end so that I can buy a phone again that I could really rely on. Sadly, this is the last time I'll use Samsung again P.s. Just typing this review already consumed 3% of my battery and it's on power saving mode to boot. Such a pathetic battery life.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"Really happy with phone, aesthetics and features and ease of use. Yes up of all the adverts popping up though and struggling to block...",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought this a week ago and is perfect with all the features it has,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I purchased the Samsung replacing an iPhone, have to say it's a good phone. It does things better than a iPhone and some things it doesn't do as well. It's the same but different.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I am enjoying this Samsung S9 but I get very irritated by adverts popping up when I am writing text messages etc,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Got my phone 2 week's ago and it's been a super easy transition. Had the S5 for 4 years prior and the change was easy to adjust to. Camera is much better, the storage is a lot bigger internally, the whole phone functions much quicker and I've been able to transfer all my apps easily. Only downside so far has been using the Spotify app, which for some reason plays music like a scratched CD player. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and trying wifi and mobile data and it's all the same, even when downloaded. This is definitely something to do with the phone and I have yet to find a fix.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Bought this phone 2 weeks ago. Works superbly. Phone looks very sleek. Only annoying feature is that you can't pick and choose which apps can show content on the lockscreen.

galaxy,4,"The screen is gorgeous, but too much on the warm side WB-wise. (Settings to make it cooler just makes the tint greener.) Battery life is terrible. Camera doesn't do portrait mode, even though other phones can do it with one camera. Other than that the phone is okay, works well, solidly built.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Used to be an iphone fan since iphone 3g, Go for the dual sim one and you will always thank yourself for migrating to Samsung and not buying iphone X The best decision I made as though took a bit to learn the interface but now realise that ios is actually now just a gimmick with android even better and great hardware from samsung.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Bought this to upgrade my S7 Edge and instantly found it more intuitive. The extra storage (64GB) has also meant I haven't even had to try to move apps onto the SD card after every update, this was becoming a pain on the S7 which only had 32GB.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Changed my s7 curve as it was too big and bulky for pockets , the s9 is perfect.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I have had a number of different manufacturers phones over the years, but I settled on Samsung around the S5. I upgraded to the S7 and now to the S9 as each contract came to an end.

However, the camera is great and good quality, the only downside is the selfie camera is not the best of quality indoors but never mind! It's still a great phone and easy to use with a good clear display.

I haven't been able to find it yet, which is very disappointing, as I rely on that. Also, the ""Always On Display"" function doesn't work. It's there in the list of options, but the lettering is in grey, and not black like the other options, so when I try to click on it, nothing happens. How can I fix this problem please?

Slimmer to use and easy to use, except the feature of the hidden task bar at the bottom which takes some getting used to! Amazing camera as expected and all around stylish phone.

The phone is easy to use (a little different from the previous Galaxy editions (S7 and below)) but still just as straight forward to use. The camera quality is really good, even when moving and I love the full screen. The colour range that you can get this phone in is really good as it makes the phone that little bit more personable and unique (I have the purple and absolutely love it!) You can also change some of the features on the phone such as colour backgrounds for the navigation panel and app backgrounds which again helps make it that bit more personal to you. The phone runs fast and hasn't slowed down at all, even with all of my apps, music, videos or photos. Love the Samsung Galaxy range and would HIGHLY recommend to anyone.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,I went from a Galaxy S6 to the S9. I am pretty disappointed. It's battery life still isn't great. The screen size isn't as good. I hate the Bixby function. The only plus points are the slow motion function on the camera and the face recognition function for times when your hands may be dirty. I am still a fan of samsung tech though so I'll persevere.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"My first Samsung 'phone was an S3. I was impressed with it, and I have stuck with Samsung Galaxies ever since, but this S9 is superb. For example, the iris recognition system is near flawless! The phone feels great to use, and everything is an incremental improvement on the Galaxy S7. It is not perfect, I have difficulty getting the voice activation to work, both Bixby and Google. But I don't use these features anyway, so I'm not worried. In summary, I think this S9 series is the best range of smartphones on the market. Well done Samsung!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,"The had it a week. No better than my previous s7, if anything the s7 was better as it had a button. Finger print sensor doesn't work",Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,First up I’m not an Apple fanboy and have had Samsung and Android devices for years. However prior to getting the S9 I’d been using an iPhone 7 for the last 20 months. 4 days on the S9 made me appreciate the simplicity and reliability of IOS plus I found the S9 too big and was not a fan of the edge screen.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought this a month ago and I'm really happy with the product,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I bought this phone a couple of weeks ago, after not having had a proper phone for two years. It's honestly the best buy I could have made. I was getting sick of phones ( starting with I) and this was a great switch. I'm enjoying that the finger scanner is on the back of the phone, it's way easier if you have small hands. I usually had to use both hands to unlock other phones, with the scanner in front, in order not to drop it and shatter the screen (which has happened before). Bixby is also a delight, I much prefer it over Siri. You have a button for Bixby (that you can accidentally press a couple of times, but it's no big deal) it's way better than having to talk to your phone like a maniac in public, to activate it. The layout is better. The options to customise are endless. And it just overall looks better. I'm definitely never going back to using other phones again",Very.co.uk

But it's not perfect, 1) you can't get audio from usb to my car like I could with iPhone. 2) bixby what a waste of time that is, really annoying and useless. 3) why don't you use stock android , trying to fix something that doesn't need fixing.

Camera is crystal clear, like really clear. Front and back. Too much to list of good things. Battery on normal use is a day, don't believe crazy stats. Normal usage, I don't pay games just social media checks, email and WhatsApp messaging. I search the net and watch the odd YouTube vid. get one.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I got this phone last week and it was the best thing I've done! I've had iPhones for the past 6 years and I made the nervous leap to samsung/Android and I have not had one regret. The samsung is so easy to use and it gives you he freedom to do What you want where as the iphone operating system limits you to what you can and can't do.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,Battery is terrible. Bought the S9 recently and realised the battery doesn't last a day or even half a day.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,This phone is amazing I even love the rounded corners of the screen but in some games this can be a little bit of a problem and i feel the need to say more ram is always good. The storage capacity is a nice size plenty of room for all the apps you want and loads left over for pics and music. Bixby is useful but could be better if Bixby could do commands for all apps as well as understanding a watered down Scottish accent lol other than that all other features are great and work really well still yet to use Samsung pay but until Natwest is accepted I will not be able to use it . Best phone I have had in years. 9/10,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I needed a faster bigger phone and this one is perfect,Very.co.uk

galaxy,2,"Got this phone just over a week ago ,had an iPhone b4 everyone tell me to try Samsung can't say I'm impressed. I really miss the iPhone",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I'm a big fan of Samsung phones so when my A3 died, I was on the lookout for another. No phone manufacturer seems to make a phone as small as the A3 anymore so it was impossible to get one as small as I needed. However, after using a borrowed S9 for a week, I realised it was dramatically bigger and it would do what I wanted and oh, so much more ! I haven't had time to figure out many of the features yet as I've only had it a week but I love it already. My favourite feature so far is the fingerprint unlocking. The only down side I've found is that the battery life seems pretty poor compared with any of my previous Samsung's and I'm having to charge it every day. Hopefully it will settle down because you can no longer replace batteries and have to buy a new phone altogether if it fails and that's not something want to have to do again for a long time.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,It has been a fair long time I have been using it and overall I feel as it is the best out there at the moment,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I've only had this phone for a couple of weeks and I love it! The camera is amazing and the 'slow mo' feature is brilliant!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Great phone. Very fast . Does everything I need it too do. Love samsung products,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Phone is great but why do they feel the need to put a Bixby button. Bixby is terrible and it annoys me no end that the redundant button is literally so close to the volume keys now.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"So happy that I upgraded to this phone, very fast.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Nice cam overall nice quick multi functions I love it u need to buy it to exploret :),Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,"Nothin spectacular. Its a phone, you can use it to make or take calls, send and receive messages, download all sorts of useless social media apps. I dont really find it much different from my last phone, a 7 Edge. Only for the fact that I was due an upgrade I wouldnt have it.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,The Galaxy S9 64GB is the best phone on the market so responsive yet simple to use . It is sleek and attractive in design and comes in vibrant colours. I have mine now for a few weeks and it features keep me intrigued offering every kind of app you can think off. The camera takes beautiful pictures with unbelievable clarity and the noise and phone sounds are pitch perfect. The security features like face and eye detection are highly advanced but offer me peace of mind that hackers are kept at bay. All in all a great phone worth every penny and many good contract deals out there to suit the buyer.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"I got this phone a couple of weeks ago as my old iPhone had very poor battery life. So far I am very impressed with the change over and have easily adapted to using an android. The only downside (which taking all things into account is a VERY small downside) is the performance on WhatsApp is not as easy and fast to use compared to an iPhone. For example, seeing the read receipts takes a lot more time than simply swiping left or right and to forward messages also ta knew considerably longer. However I strongly recommend this phone for anyone and it seems extremely reliable in terms of battery life and performance. I have this phone in a lovely lilac colour that is a gorgeous addition to my handbag that adds femininity but also class!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,I bought this phone about a week ago as it's alot cheaper than my current contract. That's why I bought it. I love the phone but the battery is disastrous. I know alot about Android phones and I mess around with them so I know what I'm doing but having to charge my phone up at 5:30 as it's dead is a massive let down for me. The American version is meant to be better though as it used a different CPU. Why we don't have the same as the US I will never know. Hopefully this can be rectified with an update.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Only had it 2 weeks...my last phone was galaxy 7...and this is a good improvement with all its features,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Excellent quality phone. Easy to use. Highly recommended. Easy to set up.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"It's super, and I love it.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Very pleased with the upgrade from the s6. My major let down is Bixby and her ability to marry up pronunciations with the actual contact etc. E.g asking for Smith and not recognising the smyth stored in your phonebook. Battery life could be improved and the headphones are poor.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had lots of different makes of phone over the years Apple phones included but this s9 by far is the best phone I've ever owned,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,I have to say I'm not enjoying this phone as much as my Samsung 6. The curved screen means hitting the edged area not only feels strange but it's difficult to tell if you have pressed the correct bit. I don't like the home bar at the bottom. The new charger port means having to carry the little adapter around with you everywhere because no-one has a charger for this phone. When I want to hang up the phone and move it from my ear the screen hoes blank and you have to fiddle about with it to get it back on just to disconnect. Curved screen protectors no matter which ones I've tried make it very difficult to use the phone even with the sensitivity increased. These are all trivial things I know but it sure means a long 2 years ahead with a phone that's just not up to scratch. Sorry Samsung.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Got this as an upgrade to my last phone which was a galaxy s7 and i can easily say it is the best phone ive ever had, easy to use, plenty of new appropriate features and a good look to the phone as well.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"From the colour, build, touch and quality of the phone to the software that seems to do everything and more lol. The photos are amazing, Wi-Fi connects fast, Bluetooth works first time. Voice calls are great, sound is great, fast charging is very good and the security is excellent, face id, fingerprint etc, works first time. Nearly everything is perfect except for, Bixby is sometimes hit and miss, more miss than hit, volume rocker should of been put on the other side of the phone and battery life could be a bit better. Otherwise buy it now you won't be disappointed.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,I bought this phone a while ago and it is ideal for my needs [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,"I've only had this a few weeks and upgraded from a Note 4 only because I needed a better camera. The screen gives me head aches and makes me go cockeyed, have played with settings which eases it but can only look at it so long. It constantly slips in my hand therefore im finding im gripping it with some pressure causing discomfort in my hand and fingers. Also the slide up back key doesn't stay up long enough. For example on Insta and some other apps its a race to double tap to back out of certain screens. As ads are the bottom of many apps or the send button sits under the bank key I've been clubbing ads and sending msgs which I was intending to back out of. It does have many great features too which is a given upgrading from the dinosaur age. I like that you can move apps around from the screens to which it downloads to Initially. I like that you can change themes so easily. Brilliant camera. Although wish you could increase the size of the widget clock more than what is available. Those are my only qualms but wrote important ones. Bar being able to not keep the phone in my hand and not look at it it's good lol.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I have had mine 2 weeks now. Overall I love it. I sometimes finger print the flash instead of the finger print pad. That is a bit annoying. I miss the quick access to the camera too. The photos are superb in low light. So far so good.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,I had this phone for a month and the notifications voloum is low u cannot even hear it......when u recive notifications....love the the rest of the phone everything else is great but i am considering of changing the phone as Samsung has let them selfs down badly.....the s7 was brillant and my expectations of the s9 should of been even more better but i fell let down by Samsung and on about changing my s9 now!!

galaxy,5,Had phone 4 weeks delighted with it would recommend it to everyone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"This is my first Samsung phone after switching from another brand I was a long term customer of. Very, very impressed so far. The S9 does everything you'd expect a premium phone to do and it does it all well. Everything I've thrown at it, it's managed effortlessly. It's a breeze to set up and transfer everything from your other handset, smart switch is fast and easy to use. Great size, clear crisp display, great camera and loads of storage space. Oh and it's FAST. Only issues so far (And they're petty minor): Bixby button. I get why Samsung are keen to push Bixby, but give us the option of remapping the hardware button to something users might find more practical for them. Also duplication of software. Do we need Samsung pay/fitness when there's android specific apps competing for use? It'd be a bigger problem where storage space was at a premium, luckily the s9 doesn't suffer from that! All I'd ask for are a bit more user customisation options so that we can have the phone running exactly the way we want with what we want on it. Other than that the S9 is a very, very capable phone. It looks good, it performs well - what more could you ask for?",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I got the S9 a week ago and I've not been happier with a phone since I tansfered over from Apple.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"The security improvements this phone provides is great, iris, Fingerprints, face unlock, device encryption with segregated secure storage.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Good phone but should be better. Bixby is terrible doesn't understand anything I say a feature Google have had working for years. This is now s9 not s2 by now all problems should be worked out.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Got this phone on an upgrade. Great battery life the camera is amazing much better than iPhone crystal clear.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I brought this phone a couple of weeks ago I think it was the best thing I did,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought this phone to replace my S6 which was showing its age as the battery was not lasting. I saw this and decided to pay the extra and get this instead of the S8. Great phone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I gave the S9 4 stars as have been using this for a couple of weeks and I love everything from the cool features (like making an emoji based on my selfie) to it learning to predict what I want to see online. However, the one thing I really don't love is that it seems that all these new cool features mean sacrificing battery life and I seem to find myself having to charge it far more often.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Going from a Galaxy S5 to the S9 has blown my socks off. There are so many things to love about this phone that I'm still getting the hang of it. Only started scratching the surface of what the camera is capable of, and the Finger print recognition is fantastic. Facial recognition is very good but opens a little too easily (opens with the Phone near my face but not looming straight at it). Bixby also not great. The button position is annoying (under the volume) and takes too many attempts to recognize certain commands.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Ive had this phone a few weeks now and i love it. Ive had it in the lilac purple and the colour is amazing. Ive always had a samsung phone so this is easy to use for me, big memory on the phone alone and room for more to insert a memory card too!. This photo is amazing and i love everything about it and how slim it is too!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"This phone is a disappointment for the money mainly due to the inability of the Contacts to connect to an Outlook address book, in this day and age it should be easy. The amount of bloatware included was also a pain and several programs that I do not want cannot be deleted such as Bixby. It is also difficult to prevent the phone from displaying notifications from people such as Samsung.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,Cannot connect to my fitbit or my Bluetooth in my car,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I've owned Samsung phones for years (Note 1 & 4, S4, S7) but switched to the Pixel 2 XL when I unfortunately shattered my S7 Edge. After an 18 month or so break it's great to come back to a Samsung handset - it seems so much snappier, the screen is amazing, and I really appreciate the extra features they add on top of stock Android. I've had my S9 for just under a week, although I'm on my phone all day every day for work so it's had a lot of use, and the call quality & mobile signal are noticably much better. The handset feels much sleeker/slimmer and is way lighter weight (yes, it is a smaller screen) and I'm also enjoying the included headphones that came in the box. I really do think Samsung make the best Android phones, hands down.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I am not very good with new phones,however this phone was so easy to set up.easy to follow instructions to move everything I wanted from my old phone to my new one.I have the purple one and it looks gorgeous.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I recently had an S7 edge which I was happy with, however an accident meant I needed a replacement. The Galaxy S9 really did feel like a full upgrade; with a superior camera, better screen design, fuller display, and added features such as smart face scanning and the sensor being moved to the back. Very happy with purchase.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I bought it two weeks ago and i love it. Highly recommended,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I bought this phone to replace my old daily driver. I have to say, after 4 months, I am not dissapointed in the slightest. It is a beautiful phone, masterfully desinged. Retained a lot of features that competitors have dropped. No faults as of my first 4 months; hardware or software. It's fast, it's snappy, responsive, a decent camera, a great screen, decent audio and wondeful looks. One gripe would have to be the extra Samsung software on-top of Google's. But hey, that is a minor gripe. Paying for what you're getting.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"This is undoubtedly a great phone - great display (again), nice lock-screen video feature, great camera. Only complaint - I generally don't like talking to my phone, because it's frankly weird. When I'm driving it makes sense, otherwise - i.e., most of the time - it's just an annoying thing that keeps popping up every time I accidentally swipe left (despite disabling it) and it also makes all sorts of demands to connect when practically every app on the phone.

Screen keeps freezing and keyboard doesn't work most of the time, it will either double click or won't work at all on certain letters, also gets very hot along with other frustrastting things like rotating the screen takes forever and need to angle in a certain way for it to work! Not what you would expect from a brand new top of the range phone given the cost of it, this is my first samsung phone and up to now will be my last.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I really do like this phone. From come g from iPhone to android was super easy. I love the camera but it does over exposes images so I use pro. It won't replace my DSLR as you can't beat a proper camera with loads of lenses but it's good for grabbing those snaps as you see them. I love the themes and how you can change the feel of your phone and how text appears is pretty cool. Battery life is really good. I admin 2 fb groups and lots of messages, what's app, texts etc etc and lasts me all day. I'm happy I got the s9 it's a cracking phone.",Very.co.uk

When I received it the boxing was very safisticated and came with extra connections and a set of headphones. The colour of my phone is lilac. It's a lovely colour. A nice sleek smart looking phone. I don't know much about technology so I have received help from my partner and son. The camera on this is amazing. The sound quality is excellent. I will enjoy using this phone. User friendly software also.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,So far this has been a beautiful and easy phone to use with some awesome features.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I bought the phone less than 1 month ago. The performance has been extraordinary!Omotayo,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I've only had it a week but I love it it's very easy to use,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I've had this for month and compared to my Galaxy S7 it's smaller and bigger at the same time easier to handle with one hand it's faster the battery isn't any better which is why it loses a star,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,Pretty awful even the camera is useless and that's what u got it for. Anything good in terms of stickers etc has to be paid for ? Apple beats this garbage hands down . Screen is tiny,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I have now had this phone for about a week, and I've played with it a lot! It is so many things; first of all, it is stunningly beautiful and sleek! It really is gorgeous to look at. The sound quality is incredible, it is not tinny at all, just pure beautiful sound, even if quite loud. Screen is the most crisp I've ever had (I ditched my iPhone for this baby, and I'm not regretting that decision one bit, I can tell you!!) Google apps and music and features are brill on it, so not missing apple stuff, end of! Call quality is also very good. Graphics on texts are nice, nice little touches on ""contacts"" as well. A good design overall, in all aspects - both the way the physical phone looks and feels as well as the fonts and graphics are appealing to the eye. - So tah dah, onto the camera: the camera is the best I've ever had; I love the vibrant, good quality photos and videos I can take with this phone. It's a dream, it really is. I've made the screen to look the way I want, I've kept and added the apps I want, I like it that I can customise the phone quite a lot, so it looks like me. Yep, at the moment I think this phone is 10/10. Happy bunny indeed.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Recently purchased my S9, wouldn't have thought it could have been much better than my S6 but how wrong. Still getting used to the phone but so far excellent and what a camera, the pictures are great. Best phones on the market",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"Brought this last week,really like the phone but am disappointed w8th the quite sound of notifications",Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,Battery life is pretty comprable to my well used S7. Ive only had it a week and the screen is noticably scrached and the official cover i bought with it broken with just normal wear and tear. Not ideal.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I brought this phone a week ago, and it's the best phone I have ever had, better than any iphone you can get and better than any other phone.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Only had my Galaxy S9 a week & already I cannot let it go! 'Tis a thing of beauty,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I am extremely happy with my s9 thanks to Samsung I love everything about it performance is second to none,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had samsung for last 8years. This is by far the best.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,2 weeks ago I got the phone I'm enjoying it graphics are brilliant,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Very pleased with my Samsung S9, bought my phome from EE been as i have been a pay as you go customer for a few years for my i phone 5s. EE have been most helpful advising me about my Samsung S9 and setting it up for me. I would most definetly buy another Samsung in the future, and recommend this phone to others.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,This is one of the best phones I've had so far. Really happy for it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,To me the phone is a jack of all trades so all in all a great phone better than anything apple can give you.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,"This phone gets ridiculously hot and drains the battery to the point it's dead. After getting it before travelling, I'd hoped I could trust it like my S8 to be able to last long days away. Needs a software update urgently to fix!!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Best phone I've ever had.........................,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Great phone with amazing features, step up from the S7 Edge. Would be 5 star if it was a step up like the S5 to the S7 but still a cracking phone.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I'm so glad I got this phone I have fun trying everything this phone can do. It's so fast at loading the information you want but the best is the camera.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I think its a very good phone as I upgraded from a galaxy 7 to a galaxy 9. While its good I wish that they could do these upgrades each year with more colours available and always have a gold casing for the phone so you are not just going to have a dull dark looking colour and not much choice. Reason to upgrade t galaxy 10 when its available is if it's in gold colour.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Bought wk ago nd I am extremely happy with it . Iv always had a Samsung handset as I they are the most trusted company iv come across never fail to deliver outstanding quality .,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I bought this handset 2 months ago and am in love with the phone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,I used to have an Honor 8 and for a third the price it had a much better battery life and snappy performance. The only benefit compared to the Honor is the camera and the screen but not worth the huge price difference.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,I like the phone but its too slim width. Videos with borders are now tiny. Also when watching 8k movies on youtube in 8k on highest setting is amazing but rhe backlight goes dark and light. Theres too many bugs to mention.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Im so happy with this Phone is amazing pictures so nice6,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I upgraded from a Galaxy S7 and so far I am very happy with my purchase,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Easy to use. Good new features, camera fantastic. Bixby a pain... not something I'd use.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,"however I've had the phone for near on a month now, and it seems incapable of finding a network, especially when I leave a wifi zone (like home or work), it needs rebooting before I get any coverage at all, and then it is poor - I got better coverage in the wilds of Alaska with my previous phone than I do in the City of London with the S9. Although I was able to transfer everything from my previous phone, the S9 seems to succeed in logging me out of my apps and some I have not been able to log into (even connect via Facebook) since I have had the phone. On a positive note the camera is fantastic, but I wanted a phone with a camera, not a camera with an occasional phone.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had the S9 a few weeks now and still learning all the new bits that my S7 didnt have!! Camera is awesome.....iris scanner is great. athe size is perfext for me. Really happy.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Had phone for a week, been amazing. Great feature...still have more exploring to go.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I've only had this a week so still getting use to it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Loved the galaxy s7 brittiant phone but the s9 has a weight that tells me better construction and longer lasting battery both very very good phones and soft wear.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"i got this as a gift a week ago, and its a big upgrade from my s7 edge. I love it!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I got this a week ago and I absolutely love it!!!!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Got this 2 weeks ago, so easy to use! Amazing cameras! Still learning but so far very impressed",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I bought this phone just over a week ago and I love it! The security features are top of the range, to the point that the face detector (which I normally don't wear make-up for) didn't even recognise that it was me when I was wearing make-up. The screen display is amazing, everything is so clear and crisp and the touch screen is really responsive. The camera has an amazing resolution and takes awesome photos and videos, although the battery length isn't the longest when using a variety of apps, this hasn't caused me much trouble as I just carry a power bank and cable. Overall, this phone is epic!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"This is my 1st Samsung phone , having had iPhone for the past 9 years. This phone is better in every way, looks, performance speed, camera and overall quality is far superior. So glad I made the change. Transferring data from my old phone was very easy, this was a concern changing from IOS to Android. Would recommend to anyone. .",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I recently bought the s9 and I couldn't be happier.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I bought it a few weeks ago and I am very happy with it, the only snag has to do with the power cable, although it comes with 2 adapters, without them all my previous cables are useless.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I am still getting to know my phone but so happy with my purchase,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Not as strong a signal as my s6 same network yet with my s6 I was having stronger signal in work,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Had this phone a week now, so glad I went back to android phone, great features",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"This phone is brilliant in almost every way. I've been an iPhone user for the past 5 years and I'd reached time for an upgrade. The iPhone X would have been my choice, but the price ruled it out. The S9 is every bit as good, but at a more sensible price and the switch to Android has been seamless. IP68 is brilliant although I've put it in a case because it's so slippery, but that pretty much h applies to most high end phones these days. The spec and features will prove spot on for most users.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"I like the eye recognition feature but it's annoying at night when it can't recognise my eyes. I could use fingerprint but because i'm so used to it being within the stretch of my thumb (last phone being the S7) and because i use a wallet case to protect the phone it's annoying having to go to the back to use this feature. Also typing in passcodes constantly is annoying. The slow-motion feature on the camera is ok but could be improved to shoot slow motion when i want it to, not when it wants to (as in waiting for something to move within the yellow square, but even then it's doesn't always detect movement). There's not a whole lot i could say about what i like because i'm a big fan of Samsung and i loved the S7. The S9 is very very similar, not much has changed at all. Even the new Bixby feature, i probably won't use it.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I had an iPhone and this is so much better. Samsung is the way forward.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I just upgraded my s7 to the s9. Wow what a great phone. Soon to have an operation on my right hand so Bixby will be a great help for texting etc. Camera is great and what fabulous clear pictures it rakes,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Everything is good ,except Bixby, it's very unresponsive even when you do advanced voice settings. Also the press & hold is a bit difficult as it's straight opposite the power button. I frequently press the power button as well, by mistake or don't hold the Bixby button down properly. A hard press or double tap would be better. Bixby is new & no doubt you will upgrade her. Google assist is responsive to my voice only every single time, Bixby, even after saving your voice hundreds of times is still frustrating unresponsive. I expect this is why most S9 users disable her. Google assist only records your voice 4 times & then it's set to recognise you every single time. On the plus side this is a fast, intelligent phone. With a lot of power & clever biometrics. The iris scanner/face scanner/finger print scanner etc, work almost perfectly. I'm quite sure there are still hidden gems I haven't yet found. I'm a bit disappointed there's no way to customise contacts notifications (I mean between each individual contact) also I don't see any improvement in the edge screen. I upgraded from the s7 edge & there are features on there that aren't on the s9. Like swiping the edge screen to see your motivations etc. Also no way of customising edge lighting from app to app, or contact to contact. I'm sure Samsung will address some issues, but I won't hold my breath. That being said if Bixby was as responsive as Google assist it would be a 5 star rating. Overall I'm happy with the phone, but I don't see much change from the s7 edge. The infinity screen shows on advert it covers the sensors/cameras (or goes around them) but in actuality it doesn't. Samsung can fix all these issues with 1 update.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,The phone is amazing!!!!!! Still learning the ropes lol,Very.co.uk

My wife is on her 4th or 5th Samsung phone, so we have a long history of loyalty, and knowledge, of their phones. It's battery life is poor considering the lead in times they have prior to launch. Having turned on, as suggested, the power saving facility, it showed a life of some 18 hours plus. It actually lasted some 6 hours. Gremlins, me thinks.

galaxy,1,I brought this a week ago thinking it would be an upgrade from my s8 oh boy was i wrong. The only difference i can see is the camera and the look of the back that is all. My s8 worked fine as the same ad this s9 but i just feel like I'm still using my s8,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Moving up from the S7 Edge you can see and feel the quality straight away. Actions are fluid and fast. My only gripe is battery, which unfortunately I feel will be a long time coming for a result. The phone is a processing monster but that eats power and if using in conjunction with Bluetooth devices then expect a day's worth of use. That aside I have to say it's a nice piece of kit",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,This is a fast and essy to use phone snd so much better than the iphone i have to use for work. I'm still getting used to all the features and customisation opportunities.

galaxy,4,"Happy enough with all the features, however if you are to use the iris scanner and have the display at the optimum performance level then you will have to make sure you carry your charger around with you for the day!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,I loved my s8 so the camera improvements in the s9 are fabulous. My only thing I'm not happy with is... I used to be able to write a text and schedule it for a later day or time and this feature has been removed from the s9. Not sure why as it's a great thing and my friends and I used to use it all the time,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"I am missing my S6 already, couldn't get this is silver so bad start straight away. There is a problem with the notifications on the phone, firstly I have the phone at max volume for notification and you can hardly hear it and secondly I play a lot of games on my phone, and the notifications sounds for my games have disappeared, they have defaulted to whatever the phone says, so for instance if I have an incoming attack I used to have a specific sound so I knew now I don't and I have checked all the settings on both the phone and games and there is no way I can change it, can you please sort this out or advise, do I have a faulty phone. The quick start camera feature was better placed on the S6, I keep restarting my phone rather than starting the camera. Considering going back to my S6 at least the notifications work, this is a real important feature for me and its just not working on any count on this phone which is a real shame.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Only had a week and I'm loving it,got knows why some ppl choose iPhone when samsung are a million times better.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I have had the phone for about a week and I bought it mainly for the super slow motion feature. So far I am very disappointed with it. It seems to have trouble detecting movement and when it does it is literally one or two seconds before it reverts back to normal speed. When it does work it's pretty impressive but so far that's only been on one occasion when I tried it indoors. I'm hoping it's nothing more than my inexperience but none of my friends seem to be able to improve it either. The rest of the features are ok but the emoji feature is somewhat problematic too, in as much as I can't seem to access it once it's done. I'm hoping that once I'm used to it I will love it every bit as much, if not more than my beloved s3. I can't say yet whether I would recommend it to a friend, unfortunately.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,Bixby is useless. Don't use it. That button should be allowed to be re-routed to action any other app or function because right now it is useless. There's more little nags...,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Incredible phone and features, still figuring some things out with it, especially ways of saving battery power.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Ive had iphone for a number of years and have always resisted the android offers. I recently upgraded and went on a ledge with the galaxy s9 and im glad i did. This phone is excellent packed with features, easy to use, and super fast. It almost negates the need for a laptop. Honestly if your on the fence about investing in the s9 you wont be dissapointed...how can it get any better? Maybe its just a tiny bit big for my hands but I genuinely think im nitpicking and the phone is excellent amd a bargain even at the high asking price.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"My partner got me this phone as a 10 year anniversary present and it is great. Being a previous iPhone user I was worried about the differences in usability and if I'd get along with it. It was so easy and intuitive to use, would definitely recommend to all. The curved screen looks great and the screen is crystal clear! The camera also works brilliantly and the images look sharp and vivid. Having the phone available in purple is also a plus. Overall, a amazing smart phone.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Previous I had the S6 and loved it so when I saw that the S9 had everything I previously had and more but was also available in my favourite colour I had to get it. Transferring all my stuff from my S6 to my S9 was do simple and fast and the phone itself is easy to use, playing games is great and my photos are better than my old photo. Haven't found anything to complain about.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"I upgraded from an iPhone to the s9. Not as straightforward to use. It keeps merging text messages and messenger, and it constantly reminds you to clean your phone trying to sell anti virus apps. I have paid for no adverts but these keep coming up. I wish I'd stayed with my iPhone.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I have had this phone under a month and I am completely in love with the array of features, astounding camera and crystal clear display. The hand held feeling is perfect and it is amazingly lightweight. It is a near perfect phone with one issue, the screen scratches extremely easily and has left me devastated for the price of the phone the screen wasn't durable which was proven by a toddler putting a small car on the screen whilst waiting for my screen protector to arrive. So I'm now stuck with some reasonably deep scratches that is too expensive to get fixed. If you buy this don't remove from the box until you have a protector and I promise you won't be disappointed just be aware that the screen is extremely delicate and to handle accordingly.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Being new to Samsung I am finding it diff9to work out.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Bought this around 1 weeks ago and loving it so far, easy to use and fun to play around with",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Whos the bright spark to put finger print on back it's a bad design and would like a physical home button but if u can deal with them small issues it's fast good picture and great value,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,Two gripes.... why oh why bixby could not wait to turn it off! Had my S7 edge 2 years never a problem had S9 3 days a screen cracked. The S9 is in a case and was in my pocket I don't recall banging it but broken. So much for Gorilla glass,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,It's still a phone. nothing stands out in today's phone choices. The camera is good. There is nothing that makes this phone stand out above the rest for the same price.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I so pleased with it latest Samsung. S9 best so far.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I've had this phone about 3 weeks and I'm really happy with the performance and stability of it. I've had several different makes and find a Samsung phones are the only ones that don't need resetting quite regular I've never lost any data on a Samsung phone. My only gripe is I wish the battery life would last about three days but I think the phone would have to be about 3 inches thick to accommodate a massive battery. That being said the battery life on this phone easy lasts the day of heavy use,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Replaced my iPhone. This phone is outstanding to use,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I have my telefoon almost two weeks ago. Very happy with device,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"It's been a month or so since i have had this phone and i am loving it! The only concern i have is the quality of the photos. Moving while taking photos is just as blury as any other phone. In the description of the S9 is to have exelent photos but as i see it, it is not as they say it is.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Well designed and easy to use. Very fast set up. Would recommend,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Waited for upgrade was going to choose I phone glad I changed my mind,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Sleek phone, looks great and has a great camera. Battery life the same as S7 though I have to charge daily.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I’ve had this phone for a week now and love all the new features it has and I like the ease I can transfer all my stuff from my old S7 to my new one without loosing anything like contacts pics apps and info, only grip I have is when I unplug my phone after charging it starts to loose its battery %. By the time I get to work which is a 45min drive I’ve lost 3-5% without using it. By the time I get home after a 10hr day it’s on 75% with hardly any use, I have all the battery saving tips advised by Samsung and it doesn’t make any difference. If that could be solved I would rate it 5stars",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"I upgraded from S7 to S9 and, although I was at one point considering different phone, am glad I chose S9.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I love my new phone, the camera is amazing and it's full of fantastic features. There are a couple of things I have already noticed it's seriously missing though. It needs an 'undo' function. I typed out a long message, highlighted it and accidentally deleted it and there was no way to get it back. They have also sacrificed the IR blaster so I can't use it as a remote for a normal television like I used to with older models . Aside from these things, I'm really happy with this phone. It's fast, the battery lasts and it more than does the job.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had the phone two weeks the camera is so sharp I can put my DLR into retirement,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I bought this phone 2 weeks ago having been an iPhone user for years and getting frustrated with the notoriously bad battery life. I have to say, over all, I'm pleased I made the switch.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Had this a week in sunrise gold the best colour in my opinion, pretty similar to my s7 few more things that I probably won't use but I like the fingerprint scanner works perfectly, seamless changeover with smart switch always had Samsung phones never disappoint",Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,Brought a month ago on second phone as first one overheated that much it kept turning off. Brought S9 because it supposed to have a good battery life my S6 has a better battery life. Second phone I have had for a week still getting hot but not enough to turn off battery life still really bad.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Amazing phone has everything I need and more. Definitely recommend.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Set up and transfer from old phone went remarkably smoothly. The phone does everything expected of it very efficiently, although I don't think it fits the hand as comfortably as my old S6.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,This is an amazing phone...... We still call them phones but really these are all in one devices that take care of just about everything imaginable. The experience keeps getting better and I can't wait to see what comes next from Samsung.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Great ultra HD photo's and video. Great at night shots.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Samsung 9 does everythong I wanted it to do........,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I have had the phone for a just over a week, I had the galaxy s8 before hand, it's very similar. Same size but I belive it's a little thicker. I like the upgraded Dolby atmos speakers a lot you can really notice the difference, also the finger print scanner has been moved and is more comfortable to use. Not much different between battery life, the one thing I think that could be improved a little is the ar emoji, unfortunately mine does not look like me at all so I doubt I will use this function.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,"Disappointed with the AI, fingerprint, iris and facial were all worse than my previous S7! Am in the process of exchanging for a P20.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Great phone,had this S9 upgrade from my S7,was in love with that one,but this is something else.loads more whistles and bells than rhe old phone,i think its a winner",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had this phone for 2 weeks already love it. Still too expensive for a phone that can bteak so easy tho,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Upgraded from the S7 so knew roughly what to expect. Camera is excellent and slightly larger size is not noticeable in the hand. Yet to try out some of the new features and some like Bixby I possibly never will, but it's there if I should have a need for it. Was given instruction on how to remove it from the screen. Do miss Upday on the swipe right screen but can use the app so no problems. All in all I'm pleased I purchased. I never recommend products as I do not consider myself qualified as dictionary definition is to state something or someone is suitable for others requirements. Speak highly or favourably then yes definitely",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I BOUGHT THIS PHONE A FEW WEEKS AGO AND IT'S AMAZING STILL GETTING USED TO SOME FEATURES THOUGH,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I upgraded to the S9 about a month ago now and I am impressed with how quick and smooth the phone is compared to my previous phone. It takes great pictures and has some cool little apps like a gif creator. I see a lot of people hating on Bixby and wanting to disable it but I think it's a handy little feature from searching the net to setting an alarm it does everything for you and if it messes up you can teach it do what you wanted with ease.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Best phone ever never had any problems with Samsung like I have with I phones,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Really good I like the fact that Bixby vision can translate to English,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I bought this phone about a week ago and i am very impressed with the phone, its got a good size screen and is very nice. I have already reccommended this phone to a friend! Love it!",Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,"I've recently bought s9 it's good but when I text mesajes the sides of the phone don't respond properly, I have to press hard ...",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I love my S9! It is so quick and efficient and has EVERYTHING I need and more! Its camera is amazing and fine the screen great to the eye and can't fault it!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,The phone has a bigger gap between the screen and frame at the top where dust and dirt collects. The screen basically hasn't be centered vertically. From what I've seen it happens fairly often. It's not the end of the world but in direct sunlight it makes a smart looking phone look grubby.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Had this shiny new piece of wonderment for a couple of weeks now none of the excitement has yet worn away. Always had Samsung but this handset is superb. The design and functionality are first class. Cant fault its performance and stylish looks. Perfect in every way and the camera, pre loaded apps inc bixby are excellent. Yes, i love this phone",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"still the best phone in the Samsung Galaxy S9 with superb picture both that and Video and the slow motion is fantastic if a little to short in duration ,build Quality and sound are second to none great device and all rounder",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Had the phone for 2 weeks now the screen and camera are amazing, also the bixby feature is great! really useful for when you need to go hands free such as driving to make phone calls. would like the battery to last a bit longer as i feel like my s7 lasted longer but still lasts a day and a half!",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Was going for the s8 but changed my mind and glad I did,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I upgraded to the S9 recently. Have always had the plus side screen but decided to go for the standard this time and I am so glad I did! My previous model was the S7 Edge and the standard S9 is pretty much the same size. Viewing screen is longer and a few mil slimmer, just prefect for me. The plus would have been too big. Amazing camera The phone is incredibly responsive and sharp No faults. I can't find a single thing to complain about. Even Bixby is good once you teach it, think of it as a puppy you have to train into a working dog. Work with it and you will find it much better then Google assistant.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I am happy with my little world. I love my phone...,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,Total samsung fan. But the new samsung 9 is terrible. No buttons. Screen is smaller. It keep doing things that I just dont need. Layout has change. Everything is just more conplicated. Its tried to be an iphone. Forgetting its core market.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I upgraded to the s9 and i love it. The camera and slow mo feature are so good! Its slick design and features are amazing. I would highly recommend it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Smooth operation, good camera, edge function is quite cool and useful. Biggest downside is the pointless samsung copy of siri with bixby. It's useless, so I disabled everything to do with it. This then leaves you with a button just below the volume ones that does absolutely nothing and can't be used for anything else.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,I've only had the s9 a week can't connect any Bluetooth devices to this phone,Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,"Basic functions, such as spellchecker and autocorrect, auto punctuate, just dont work (see what i mean... doesnt atomatically onsert apostrophe or capitalise the 'i'l). Screen is sivnificantly smaller than my S7. I dont care how mamy extra whistles and bells, that ill never use, if you cant get the basics right. Wish id mart let my old phone go.... very very let down, a waste of valuABle resources",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I brought this less than a week ago to replace my ageing Sony Xperia and I wouldn't go back -. Everything runs seamlessly, picture quality while watching video is brilliant. The dual lens camera is a revelation, the images are crisp clear and true to life colour.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I am beyond happy with my Samsung Galaxy S9. This is the 4th Samsung Galaxy phone I've owned, I know them well so when I upgrade I never consider another brand. This time is no different. It's a great phone with some really fantastic and unique features and an amazingly stunning camera. I love the stylish design as well.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I bought this phone a week ago as my old one broke. Haven't had chance to do a lot yet. Took a few pics but all the different sorts of shots were still confusing to me,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,I brought this phone last week. Since then it's had 2 software updates and still keeps crashing everyday. Keeps kicking me out of the gallery and crashing when trying to take photos. When I do take photos the quality is poor. I do not recommend.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Had it a week - love it. Solid design, great display, fast and responsive and cracking sound!",Very.co.uk

There are a lot of great new features and its very worthwhile watching the tutorials and learning more about your new personal assistant Bixby, only had my phone a couple of weeks and still learning but loving all the new features. Only downside I felt was the colour as Id ordered online I got the coral blue but was a little dissappointed as I thought it would be a lighter colour as this is how Id seen it in the pictures, wish Id ordered lilac instead, just a cosmetic detail though.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"love my samsung got a great deal from my smashed s8, have recommended this phone to lots of folk",Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,Upgraded about a month ago. Still getting to know it. Not sure whether i like some of the features yet,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I have had the S9 for a week and keep missing texts. This is because you can only use one notification sound. Unbelievable but true. So either you pick up your phone every 10 seconds for every notification to check if it's a text or you ignore it (or forget that it's the same sound) and miss the text.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,"The phone seems very good, but unfortunately it developed a fault on the second day. 10% of phone screen became unresponsive to touch and so the navigation bar did not work.

galaxy,3,I. Had the S8 edge and I thought this phone (S9) would be a straight swop. In fact I have been quite irritated by it. I seem too get constant suggestions for things I don't want. Bixby kept appearing til I got rid of it. Samsung pay was the same . And the keyboard and its predictive text is far worse. When you slide your finger to spell a word it often splits it into two nonsensical ones. The sworn over has been far from smooth.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Have this phone a week now, and am in love. Phone feels good as a say earlier,and features are good PLUS the camera is beautiful.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,"Tried to switch from iPhone to this phone because of the dual sim feature, but this was so user unfriendly that had to return it today. Battery life was poor (despite all the optimisation) and Samsung Pay stopped working (leaving me stranded on the tube once). The screen and the camera are great but I struggled to do things with the phone overall - very non-intuitive and poor ux/ui",Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,There too many apps that work with other apps so you cant delete to save space because they work together. Ok Google and Bixby don't do what I ask. The Bixby button is in the wrong place and I keep pressing the button by mistake. Some websites don't work 100%. There's no spell checker so had to download one so taking up memory. Couldn't transfer all my iTunes over only a hand full of songs. Miss my iPhone so much easier to use.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Bought this phone a few weeks ago and have to say best phone I've ever used. The speed is amazing the display is so clear, the camera quality and speed are the fastest I've seen on a phone even better than some stand alone cameras, and the battery life is not too bad depending on which power options you choose. I do like the way you can customise the phone to the best way that suits your needs and the connectivity to other devices is quick and seemless, a real pleasure to use",Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,"This is my first Samsung and so far the experience has been very frustrating even annoying.All my smart phones up to now have been iPhones and they were always a joy to use from the get go.Not so the Samsung.Its fiddly to use and not as easy to navigate as the iPhone.Friends tell me it takes time to get used too,but the iPhone was instantly user friendly.Basically,come back iPhone all is forgiven!",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Been using for just a week, while at the Le Mans 24hr race. Brilliant phone, everything you could want in the palm of your hand and best of all, no 'i' prefix. Take car of the screen though. It does appear to be a little fragile. I've already got 2 scratches and a small chip due to others around not being careful at the charging station on the camp site. Thankfully my case is waiting for me at home, sadly it wasn't delivered before I left for France. Learn from my, VERY EXPENSIVE, mistake, get yours straight into a good case.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,"Having had a G3 G4 G6 and G7 I was so excited by the new G9, looking at the adverts anyway, but after unboxing, charging and setting up I am now so disappointed with it, overall I don't think its any better than my G7 and Camera wise its a huge step backwards, the amazing wide angle lens on the G7 meant you could take fantastic landscape shots and get entire people in without standing 20 foot back. Now its so narrow its impossible to get a lot in a picture, even standing back a good distance away. The lighting is awful as well, where I could touch and adjust the back light on auto shots( not having to worry about other settings as well) I now can do this and would have o use Pro settings meaning its not just point and shoot. Deciding whether to give it to my wife and take back my G7 I gave her last week! Very Very Disappointed !",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,Having been a Nokia owner for years I took the plunge and switched to Samsung. Having managed my way round the S9 there are loads of great features and apps.

galaxy,4,"Decent enough phone, great features as you'd expect with any Samsung model. I've got slight issues with regards to messaging - having problems with setting a delay when sending a message where before I could see and correct and potential errors prior to sending. Scheduled messaging is a bit of a pain also. Notifications are also a nuisance because I can't seem to turn them off after they've sounded once, the longest delay is them sounding every 15 minutes. Annoying.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,I had the samsung s8 and moved to the s9 on a good deal but to be honest for me i dont really see to much of a difference from the s8. I rarely use the camera so i dont see the slow mo camera. The one big thing that really is a HUGE boost is the dolby atmos sound what a great idea and i use it all the time.

""Whilst using a phone case with a flip cover for the screen"" How do i get the phone to lock when i cover the screen with the flip cover insted of pressing the lock button?? I had the S7 edge and it had that feature but i cant find it on the S9. Any feed back would be great Thanks",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"I upgraded last month having owned an s6 Edge for over 2 years. I have to say the case itself looks and feels cheaper as more plastic than my old S6 Edge. Love the biometric security. I tried Samsung pay but had to use Google pay as my cards weren't supported. Mixed results with Bixby so jury is still out on that. The camera so far seems excellent with only one thing I miss, which is ability to take picture with main camera as well as a selfie into the same photo. Love the ability to rotate the home screen from portrait to landscape. That is one thing I really liked early on. Setup has so far been very straightforward and easy. There was only one thing I've had to research so far and that was when setting up the keyboard and switching predictive txt on, as it didn't work. I then found out you have to download the language pack even though its say UK language was installed. I was hoping the battery performance might have improved to the quality of certain competitors, but no luck on this side. However, charging is very quick. So far though, I'm very happy with the phone and was definitely the right choice for me.",Very.co.uk

The screen clarity is fantastic and the curved glass allows for a very immersive experience. The front facing camera is great quality taking vibrant photos, but I was a little disappointed by the selfie camera due to the sheer price of the phone. Furthermore, despite my phone being just over a week old it does suffer from ocassional glitches which is very disappointing after such a recent purchase.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I traded up from the s7 edge to the s9 and I have to say, I love it! It's the wee touches like bigsby and the edge lighting. How it looks and feels. Of course not to mention the screen movement. Which is always sublime with Samsung. You can't go wrong",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Got this phone on a great deal with EE 3 weeks ago and i'm over the moon. Going from an Samsung galaxy S5 2016 to this is a massive jump. Screen and design is beautiful, performance is great, the audio is amazing with speakers in two places giving it surround sound and you can't forget the camera! One thing I love a lot though, is the amount of features, although there are some most people won't use, it is soo much fun constantly finding out new things about this phone whether it be through the internet or youtube. I'm not a massive fanboy for any brand but this phone is very pleasing. Can't really think of anything bad but battery could improve a little as this phones great performance and use of a lot of features can use up the battery a bit.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,"I have had a lot of problems with this phone. I took it back to Verizon before my 14 days were up and told them I hated it. All was done is they called customer service and they were supposed to have fixed the issues. I continue to have dropped calls, people not being able to hear me and poor service at home and many places that I had no problem with my old phone. As soon as I am able I can I plan to get another phone but I am stuck with this one for 2 years! I have told many of my friends NOT to purchase this phone. I would not recommend it to anyone. Going to Verizon doesn't do any good. It is Not worth the money! My husband has the S8 and has no problem with it.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,I've had the phone for 2 weeks. Premium quality and so fast compared to my previous iPhone 7.

galaxy,4,"I got the s9 a week ago and i absolutely love it. I love the design, the screen, the colour, the features within the phone etc. BUT the front facing camera quality is awful. The back camera is perfectly fine, in fact the quality is really good but the front camera puts a weird blurred veil sort of thing over it. It's like there is a permanent beauty filter that you can't turn off but instead of making the picture beautiful it makes the picture look blurry and sort of pixelated/grainy. For a phone so expensive I expect A LOT more from this.",Very.co.uk

Not keen on the location of the finger print sensor either - right next to the camera lens on the back of the phone and I can see the lens getting dirty easily.

Otherwise, my first Samsung disappointment and wished I hadn't given my excellent S7 to my wife!",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,I got this as a present however as i used a galaxy s8 previously it is very similar which i dont like i wanted more. However what you do get is a great screen perfect for watching movies and playing games. The pictures are great. Great camera. And dolby atoms gives it that bit extra when listening to music and surround sound on speakers. I should have waited because i really want the gold version coming soon,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,My last phone was a galaxy S7 and I loved it but this is a whole new world. The performance is really sharp and snappy. I had to charge my old phone up half way through the day as I had a lot running on it but the S9 lasts for over 24 hours with the same apps running. I am starting to get to grips with Bixby and some of the other new features but a week into getting it and I live this phone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"So I gave 4 stars. Only reason that is, battery. At 3000mah and the power behind this phone it doesn't match up. Would like to see a Mophie case soon. I keep it on med battery saver and it can go 2 days with moderate use. Little over a full day with heavy use. If its left to it's own full potential, with full use, your looking at a half day to 3/4th. So my only gripe is the battery. Like I said, a Mophie case would be great, then there shouldn't be any issues with battery. The s9+ does offer 500mah more at 3500mah, but again, with 6 GB of ram and the power of the phone, cant see that making the plus run much longer, give or take 3-5 hours on max use. Having said all that now to the good stuff. The unboxing was awesome. I got the midnight black and it just looks so sexy to the eye. That Corning gorilla glass 5 is nice to the touch and makes the over all build sleek and easy to handle given its dimensions. The screen is amazing. I have had the phone about 3 weeks now and maintain at FHD. I haven't had use yet for uhd but if it's anything like the FHD I know I'll be impressed. Pictures and videos are so vivid and real, the added infinity screen just brings video and photo over the top. I have also been using both as standard, I have yet to play with any features which themselves are incredible enhancements. The sound. It's just stupid incredible, must be heard to believe. Simple as that. UI is simple. The added advanced features get some getting use to but once intermediate level is achieved the phone becomes far more advanced than you can imagine. This review is after 3 weeks and using it on its standard level. I am getting to specials now so I will make a review about that soon enough. But so far this phone is unmatched. My friend at work has the iPhone x and we compare every day and the Galaxy wins every time. More reviews to come. Starting out though. Its incredible. I'm very pleased and look forward to accessorizing this to the T.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I brought this phone just under to weeks ago and it's brilliant so easy to use,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I recently done a early upgrade as my old phone was playing up and slow and this Samsung s9 is the best phone I've ever own and I'm glad switched,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I brought it 2 weeks ago and it is perfect also quite strong and great it also has a great very bright screen and the edges are great although there is some problems which are not big and that is the battery size 3000mah it would be better if it was 4000mah and the ram and samsung skin it is easy but not as fast in loading apps compared to one plus it would be better if samsung did an update that made the faster but making the skin use less ram,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought this couple of weeks ago and its fantastic,Very.co.uk

I thought that it would take some getting used to moving to an S9, and I thought that I would lose a lot of features. However, from the moment I set up the phone (which even transferred everything from my apple!) I am thrilled. The phone, screen display, apps, UI and everything is far superior and I feel like I have a new modern gadget again. Way to go Samsung!!",Very.co.uk

Best mobile phone on the market to date.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Simple transfer from my old S7. Great features although some take time to set-up. Samsung Switch transferred all apps, photos and videos, accounts needing logged into from new phone. S9 is a great size, screen is clear and does not distort at the edges",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"Had the s9 for a week now, love the interface and the new control bar along the bottom. Camera is awesome, phone is quick and responsive and seems quite sturdy. Bixby needs some work and higher functionality with third party apps, take spotify and google maps as an example. I dont have bluetooth in my car so use a phone holder with aux lead. If i want to be able to skip tracks or search for the nearest fuel station i need to pull over to do this safely. So 4/5. Dropped 1 mark due to limited Bixby functionality. But all in all, a great phone",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"I brought this phone just over a week ago. I think it's a great phone, much better than my IPhone 6S theirs a lot more memory and more things to do on it. The only problem I found was it being too thin, to hold safely, without having it in a case. It's so easy for it to slide right out of you're hands, I found it was easier to accidentally drop, then the IPhone. Other then that. It's a really great phone to have and I'm so glad I choose it.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,"The os is abit clunky, not mad keen on the way you go back, like on a website. The swipe up to get the box. That should just be there all the time. The in built text function is weak, the first thing I did was download another. Not mad keen on the fact I can't seem to get a banner notification to illuminate my screen, so half the time I don't know my phones gone off when it's on silent. Even though I've turned off bixby, it randomly just opens, which is annoying. It also doesn't seem to like my WiFi, so nothing loads when it's connected, which is odd. Besides that, it's a sturdy phone, quick, good camera.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"This is my perfect phone! I love all of the features and it's perfect for me. The phone is so fast, sleek, perfectly sized. The camera quality is absolutely incredible and the screen and audio are so vivid, clear and bright.

galaxy,4,"Changed from a S7 edge to the S9 and phone almost perfect, almost ! The one feature missing which I, and probably coutless others used was the corrective texting feature which if you misspelt a word you could highlight it and you got a drop down list of alternative spellings / words. As I had been using it for 2 years on my S7, I and probably countless others really miss it. It would be brilliant if Samsung could re-instal this feature through a software update to make the phone a perfect 10/10 ?",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Got this phone 2 weeks ago so easy to get used to. Curved screen looks nice but nightmare for putting on screen protectors if wanted on it like I did took the pro 3 protectors and manymore attempts with those 3 to get it on right.

galaxy,4,"It's a great phone but feels like not much has changed since the S7 in terms of the . Camera is a bit better and has new features. The selfiemoji feature is a bit weird, doesn't look like me at all. The edge feature is pointless and gets in the way of things. Same goes for Bixby. It glitches sometimes but I'm hoping that won't get any worse. I'm not saying it's a bad phone, just that it's an S7/S8 with added useless features.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,It clearly stated 24hour battery life! I am completed shock to see how rubbish the battery life is on this phone. It doesn't even last your 12hours.

galaxy,3,"this phone is getting frozen very often, quite often I don't have any reception. the positive thing is the sound. in general my previous phone samsung galaxy edge 7 was the best which I've ever had, there was no problem within for 2 yers. samsung galaxy 9 is really worst than 7",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had about a month don't really need or use all features but good to know I could if I wanted to. Just use as a phone really small internet not much photo or video. No music occasional Sat nav. No social media.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I've been buying Samsung phones since 2012 and I'm always very happy with them and so far the S9 lives up to my expectations. Instead of having to wait in the store while the sales person transfer anything you now are able to do it at home on your own time and the start up was very easy. I especially like the new feature of the edge so instead of having multiple screens for the apps I just have that 1 little sidebar that's hidden. I also like the ability now to leave my phone unlocked in ""trusted"" places which is nice when I'm home. My one complaint, and it seems small but that's a pretty big to me is you can't individualized text message alerts for people so I can't tell right away if it's my mom or my crazy ex boyfriend texting me. Please bring back this feature on the next update.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,"After just 2 days the phone developed a fault, consistently wouldn't open apps even after uninstalling then reinstalling. Also the screen intermittently wouldn't respond to touch so unfortunately my experience wasn't great. I did love the phone and would still recommend it, I was just unlucky.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Good phone but iPhone × is better camera and performance. But is a good phone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"After how many years my husband and I switched to Samsung since it contains a lot of features. Its actually not so hard to switch cause its really user friendly. I am actually a camera addict that's why I really loved it, especially the AR Emojis! My friends also love it when I use it while I'm taking a video and singing my favorite songs for my hubby. I can actually use it all day without charging. There was a time when it logs but its pretty fine, you just have to wait a second or 3. Overall I really love it. I am actually recommending this to my friends already.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Had myS9 for 2 weeks now and compared to the S7 edge, which was also an excellent handset, seems faster and clearer. On the downside the charging port is now different to the S7 which made any extras such as the Samsung vr gear now incompatible, thank you Samsung I was genuinely disappointed that I have to replace this!! On the upside the handset feels better in your hand and the screen has no annoying buttons anymore. The camera is amazing and I have only just scratched the surface...It can do so much more that I haven't tried as yet. I am looking forward to trying all the other features out.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,The phone maintains what I liked from my previous samsung phone and added a bunch of cool new stuff,Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"I had a Galaxy S6 loved that phone so I wanted to stay with a Samsung Galaxy so got the latest which is the S9 and I am not disapointed very easy to use and more memory. The only thing is that the Bixby voice recognition is not very good, have got fed up and now don't use it",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I love my new galaxy s9 coral blue. It has a fantastic camera, excellent speed and very nice design.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I have only had my phone for a week but love it already. I have s3, s5, and S7 and have loved them all. This one feels slighty small than my S7 edge but its quite alot faster. Not tried all the fearures yet but so far so good.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Updated to the 9 from the 8 and although I love the layout and usability of Samsung the changes made on the 9 aren't as user friendly as the 8. Had to download a new keyboard as no predictive text and was told by the suppling store that many phones had this problem. Too many apps and things have been moved around and difficult to find. Haven't really found anything that is better than the 8 yet. But overall its still a good phone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought this 2 weeks ago. I love it. The camera is brilliant. I am a photographer and have shared some photographs which people have thought I've taken with my main D800 Nikon camera. Well done. Love the emojies too - my kids have had such fun emojie themselves.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I had the s7 and was due an upgrade. The s9 has such a good camera, taking the perfect picture and with the slow no feature is good as well. I like using bixby which is new this time round. The screen is slightly curved on the edges which particarly am not keen on. Only because of screen protection. Other than that. The phone is great for all social media. Bigger screen to watch your videos. All in all. Very pleased",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"The design isnt what im used to, but overall the phone is great. No problems what so ever with the overall performance.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,It's got some great features but iris recognition stopped working after 3 days and it keeps coming up with proximity sensor disabled not great wish I kept the S7 edge,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Still getting used to everything my phone does after only a week but loving it.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Can't quite get the use of slow no as it doesn't make it clear when it's started and doesn't last for very long. One of the reasons why I bought this phone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"The phone is brilliant, dont get me wrong, everything about the phone screams quality and performance, but the software still isnt on par with the offerings from other major brands. Alot of features are handy, nifty and very cool but others seem useless and Im not sure how or when I would ever use them, game mode for example can lock the screen on an app, which is clever in principlw but in reality it means that in order to play the game, the screen must then be unlocked from game mode and back into normal mode... And Bixby, oh boy. Bixby is trying to be on the same level as alexa or siri but theyre just not on the same par, bixby is still somewhat primitive and slow to load, which happens an awful lot thanks to the placement of the ""Bixby button"". Placing a button used by so few directly underneath the volume rockers was definetely the poorest design move throughout the entire phone. Even just the possiblity to remap the button would be greatly appreciated, as of right now, to do so requires extra apps and software, to be connected to a computer and a little bit of coding, there must be an easier way",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"After having an apple phone for years and becoming totally bored with the brand I decided to give android a go again . I'm soooo glad I did , I absolutely would recommend this phone to every one ...I know now what I've been missing all these years",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"so only a week but this is a great new toy. I loved my 7 edge, and nearly did nt upgrade as I was such a great phone, but this is a fantastic phone. love the feel and the look, the biometrics are superb as well. Very pleased.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I replaced my old S6 with the S9 and I am more than happy. I love the ""Spam Alert"" feature, very useful. I use the finger print security lock which gives me extra peace of mind. It's a lovely lilac colour and feels good in the hand. The camera has come in really useful when filming my kids at play. Priceless.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had this phone a week S9 brilliant cannot go wrong with this phone it has everything cannot knock it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,My first premuim phone at a premium price. Is is worth it ...too early to tell.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Only had phone couple of weeks and love it. Always rated the Samsung brand and this is an excellent addition,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I bought this a week back because i read amazing reviews and liked the features of this phone. It has been very upseting for me that none of the spell check and auto correct functions are working and it is very difficult to type. I dont know if its just my phone or all S9s with the same problem.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I had a lot of trouble deciding what to get next - the choices in the premium range of smartphones is good at the moment and I was struggling. However, after much deliberating I decided upon the Galaxy S9... And I could not be happier with my choice. First of all it is the most beautifully designed handset I have ever owned: sleek, contemporary and a joy to hold in your hand. The camera - which was really important to me - is nothing short of breathtaking and the operating system is fluid, intuitive and works at incredible speed. A few years ago I owned the S7 Edge and loved that but this device has clearly moved things onto another level. Perfection.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought this just over a week ago and I love it so chuffed with it,Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,"Had it delivered last monday and it was faulty so had to send it back. Waiting on a new one to arrive, was looking forward to using my new phone so very disappointed.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I'm now on my 5th Samsung going as far back as my little flip phone with the colourful fish screen. My last one went through a 60° wash and still worked fine. Wouldn't buy any other make.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Fantastic phone. Would definitely recommend to everyone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Upgraded a week ago and has been (aside from some gmail calendar sync issues) pretty seamless. Hate the bixby key though. If I want to use an app like that, if rather select it not press it by accident. I've turned it off, but bit silly that it can't be remapped to provide a function that would actually be of use... Otherwise excellent.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I brought my phone 30th April and I like it very much easy-to-use. Better than my old Samsung Galaxy S7.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I switched to GalaxyS9 from my Honor 8, and the new phone is quite good but not a massive surprise in user experience. The battery does not hold it for a whole day, the full-screen experience is something what I cannot enjoy because I must have a cover on the phone all the time -since I know (from expreience with S6 edge) how expensive to repair the broken screen. All together I'm happy with the phone and I will keep it , but if there will be a new phone with lasting battery, and an unbreakable screen from any manufacturer I will definitely switch to that.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,actually this phone is fantastic much better than the S7 I had before. I even like the Samsung case ( the 25 quid grey one )I bought with it it feels nice to the touch. I like the fact it is lighter than the S7 so feels more comfortable in my pocket. The sound is very good and picture very good also. I use it a lot a bit like a toy to entertain me. Very happy with it.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"I bought the S9 a few weeks back after dropping my S7 Edge, I have to say it's great! Photo quality has improved quite a bit, the sound is phenomenal and visually it's beautiful. Bixby is very new to me and is hard to get used to (especially with the left side button) All I've used it for at the moment is to turn on the flashlight. But watching some videos on it I'm sure there's plenty it can do. With the S7 Edge I had some issues with the edge of the screen when watching videos or playing games where my finger would touch the sides and throw me onto the edge panel of even change the video I'm watching. With the S9 I no longer have that problem. Overall 4 stars. I'm still a Samsung fan. Well done.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Bought this phone a month very happy with it best phone out there,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I've had this phone for a little over two weeks now. And I am very happy with this phone. I had the s7 edge before, for 2 years. I've had 3 people have a go on the s9 and they went out and purchased one just because they had a go on my device and enjoyed the experience.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,A week in and I'm very happy with the phone. Can't quite get to grips with the super slow motion camera though.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Camera is excellent. I'm having problems with intermittent audio loss during phone calls, which Samsung are aware of and are working on. Some of the functionality/accessibility is not as user friendly as could be. I find I'm ending up with application windows being resized when I didn't mean to.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Very quick delivery and good product..............,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,"Calls drop all the time faulty,,, ppl can't hear me.. I can't here them..... not a happy bunny",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Really fast, awesome camera. Perfect so far. Highly recommended.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Great phone amazing camera just overall brilliant phone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,For one it is not good for calls. Makes people sound Muffled. The text messaging you cannot Customize can't even set a different tone. You can only choose what Is already pre programmed in the phone. Voice texting completely sucks. This phone has really cool features that I will probably never use. The speed of the phone is pretty good too. Would I recommend this phone probably not I would say wait for them to work the bugs out of it. Can't wait to change phones.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,My first Samsung after 4 HTC phones. Great features and brilliant responsive screen,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought this on my birthday. I was about to buy the one plus 5 but so glad I chose ur phone instead,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,"My phone keeps cutting in and out. No one can hear me well. I just bought it 3 weeks ago and now in order for me to get it fixed I have to mail it to them, then what do I do for a phone. This really sucks for what I had to pay for it..:(",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I have just got this pho e and i love it already so easy to use i even managed to transfer all my photos and thats unheard if for me,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"After a 4 year stint with an iPhone 6, I decided it was time for a change. Overall I'm very happy I made the swap to the dark side, the features available in the s9 run rings around most aspects of Apple's OS. Particularly freedom to use the phone how you like with unlimited customisation. The phone itself feels very well built, easily as good quality as Apple's offerings- one thing that put me off android in the past was the cheaper feel some handsets had. I do have one small request though, I don't use bixby, at all.. I'd like the option to have the bixby button remappable to something like the camera or silent mode.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I have only had this phone a week but love it - having had a Galaxy 7edge before. I like the slimness and the features of being able to have it unlocked in trusted places. The fingerprint recognition works really well on this for unlocking apps. I dont do the selfie thing so not really experimented with much there but the camera itself is excellent. The only concern I have is the screen - screen protector covers don't stay in place because of the curvature so did not buy one.. and not convinced that even the most expensive Samsung case I bought will really protect the screen itself.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I love the s9 for so many reasons, the screen is brilliant, the camera is exellent and the sound is top notch, but if i have to say some complaints, is that the battery life isnt great but i know why you are worried about that and the autocorrect on the keyboard just doesnt work for me, dunno why but if you can send a email explaining why that would be appriciated, but otherwise that, it is a great phone.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Good phone love samsung easy to use brilliant picture quality,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Best phone ever , bought it 2 weeks ago , and still learning all the new things that my new Galaxy S9 will do !!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Phone nice and fast great refresh speed. Spelp check auto dictionary is pathetic S7 was much better. Also can not assign seperatenitification tones to email mesages etc. Also no edge screen which shows rhe time. Tgis was a great feature on the edge phones.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Camera is the very best in the market screen is beautiful,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,One of the best phones I've had! I would recommend this phone to anyone even if you've never used an android before.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Having upgraded to this phone am delighted with all aspects very comfortable to carry and to use no problems so far .extremely easy to upgrade from s8,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I have had my S9 for a month now and am still learning all the useful things on it but it's performance is top notch. I have however noticed a drop in connectivity for voice calls, 4G Tec whci is disappointing.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Been using this for about a week now and the performance is amazing. The grip's a little slippery and still getting used to the wide screen but that's about it! Love it!,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,got a fantastic deal with this phone beenusing samsung for years never had any problems with themy,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,Great phone and performance. Works great but the batery life is terrible!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Good allround phone very compact and great to use and great camera,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,So pleased with this phone easy to use love it highly recommend,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Upgraded from the s7 edge to the s9 & the batterry life is worse & performance less responsive.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Samsung have played it safe as of late. Disappointed that the design is almost identical to the S8. It's by no means ugly, but just a bit of a shame. And there's not much going on inside besides the annual processor upgrade. The new camera doesn't even seem to jump out massively for me. I upgraded from an S7 Edge and I don't feel I've gained more. The phone is really fast though and it remains a really nice slick experience. Also glad to have stereo speakers on a phone. But overall, it's hard to justify as an upgrade if you have an S6 onwards.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"omg. where do i start??!! the s9 is packed with the best features that any phone can provide. it is more than i expected. the features such as Bixby, the camera quality (it even has a cam for food pics), pic filters, resolution, and wwwwwwwww the speakers on this phone are amazing. they are atmosphere Dolby. so you can play anything on this phone and it will make the sounds kind of hug your ears and surround sound. i played music via my phone with an aux cable in the car and even the sound in the car sounded different, it was more bass to it and just incredible.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I got this phone as an upgrade from an iPhone. It has so much more storage space a lot easier to use. the camera quality is excellent. This is my first Samsung and it's safe to say I wouldn't go back to the iPhone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,wasn't the best impression i thought i'd try android and thought where better to start than samsung and the battery on the s9 was so poor i've already returned the phone and gone elsewhere,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Got this phone couple of weeks ago and I love it, their is so much to do on it and loads of memory used to have a iphone wouldn't go back to one",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Ive had the phone for 3 weeks now and so pleased with my purchase. The camera is outstanding quality. The phone features are improved on the previous Samsung's. Overall excellent product.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I am still playing with Bixby, i like a couple of features like where i have parked my car.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Great phone very good camera. Fingerprint scanner on the back is annoying. Ar emoji is brilliant.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I got this as a gift and the display and camera are sooo good. Speakers too. Definitely worth the money.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Small neat phone. Good ergonomics. Convenient software - except for childish Bixby button, which needs a rethink.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,great phone keep up the good work cant wait to see the next phone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,I preferred the S6 and the samsung switch app didnt bring everything across. Wish I hadnt upgraded..,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I got my phone a couple of weeks ago and it's great,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I had the iPhone x and this s9 is a lot better wins hands down,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I got my phone just about a month ago and I love it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Happy I choose the s9 over others although I did look at p20. Samsung products and backup is excellent so this was main reason.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I bought 2 weeks ago I'm happy with that device but is not perfect but nearly perfect. I'm very happy,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I bought it a month ago and I have no complaints, so far so good. I love camera quality and new selfie options. I like the health check options, all it needs now is to write me a prescription lol. I've installed many extra apps and the phone still performs well, doesn't seem to be slowing down. Beautiful design, great phone, I'm looking forward to discovering more exciting new features... im yet to try Bixby!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,The phone is the same as every other Samsung of late except for the iris and facial recognition software but the battery life is dismal I have to charge the phone at least twice a day even when I'm not using it as much,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Bought this as my first Samsung/Android phone and switched from Apple. Great modern phone with unique features,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,I bought this phone around 1 week ago and I have noticed a big decrease in battery life. The phone sometimes doesn't even last me a day.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought my phone just over a week ago it's the best phone I've ever had so fast at connecting to internet picture and sound quality is amazing,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I upgraded from a Samsung S7 and this phone is outstanding. The ease of using Samsung cloud to seemlessly transfer all documents from my old phone to my new was so simple.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,I checked the specs and saw it had a tray to add 2 SIM cards so I thought very useful so got it now I'm disappointed it doesn't have it.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,I find the phone ok but it is slow sometimes and the signal isnt great...always havibg troubke with coverage,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Bought this phone on recommendation from my daughter, must admit, well impressed, lots of features still to explore",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,On contract with EE VERY HAPPY. Good quality pleased,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Nice phone with a few new features haven't had time yet to explore them all. 2 year contract was up so I shopped around and found a good deal on the S9 upgrading from S7 edge. Always found Samsung phones full of extras the only thing I've found missing so far that I loved is the option to personalise text tones for contacts something I really hope is put back on the phone in an update soon!!!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I have only had my new S9 for a week its great. Im still discovering what i can do with this mobile. I love the sharpness of the camera its fabulous,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,"Every phone call has short periods of around 3 or 4 second of silence, ok with friends but not on calls with various companies where they think you have disconnected",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Bought this over a week ago, and so far really impressed. Loving the cameras new functions",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I wonder is there a problem with other samsung s9. The first 1 kept cutting out during a call and some times this new s9 does the same. Overall fantastic,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I had the Galaxy S7 however the S9 is just as easy to use but much smoother,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had my phone a week and would recomend it to anyone,Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,Good phone still don't like the bixby button very nice screen quality,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I love it but its difficult to navagate but easy to get used to eventually, the texting is pretty bad but i may not have found the keyboard setting that predicts",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Bought it a month ago and it's the best phone I have had by far!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"This is a feature rich, premium phone, but the response on the touchscreen feels quite sluggish compared to my last phone (a Sony Xperia X). Switching between screens is fast, but sometimes opening apps from notifications can take an age. I think there's still a lot of work that needs to go on to bring this phone up to spec.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I've had this phone for about a week and I love it! Camera is brilliant, other features are fantastic, phone itself is pretty nice to look at and use. The only small issue I have found so far is when using the slow-mo video indoors: in a room that is reasonably well lit, when taking a regular photo/video, the picture cones out clear, colourful and looking good, but if try to use the slow-mo feature, the video becomes extremely dark (sometimes to the point of not actually being able to distinguish anything on the screen), and it also flickers a lot. Other than that, I have not had any problems so far.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,A lot faster and better than my previous iPhone. Undoutably the phone on the market.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Great phone but i feel the battery is a bit on the small side as I am a user that is usually out for a good 16 hours some days. And can make the phone not last a good day as I have had other phones that have had been withstand without the use of power saving but the wireless charging definitely makes it easier to negate this problem as slot and go in the dock in the car. The features are great never used a phone that is so fluid to use, the always on display is great but i think for longevity reasons they should use the proximity sensor so the screen isn't used when in a pocket.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had this for two weeks now so very happy with it so much better than the s7,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,This phone does everything you would want it to. I am not really technically minded but it is so easy to navigate and explore all the great features.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,I bought this phone about a week ago and it was a great choice however the battery life only seems to last 5 to 6 hours even though the estimated battery life at medium battery saving mode is around 10 hours.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Only had it a week but love it camera very good sound from speakers are excellent,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had the phone for about 2 weeks so many cool features and lots more to explore.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Love the phone, i have icons and desktop personalised and it looks and works exactly as i would like. I have one major problem though. When take a phone call over the loud speaker about 10 seconds into every phone call i lose connection for about 4-5seconds and then it comes back. happens every time, very annoying!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Got this phone just over a week ago and am, on the whole, quite happy with it. There are some very annoying features about it tho - getting the screen to activate is not easy, you have to double press the 'home' key and it doesn't always work fist time; there seems to be 'dead' parts on the screen and you have to press really heavily to get certain characters.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought the galaxy S9 and is absolutely brilliant. I had the galaxy 7 and I thought that was good. The S9 is so much easier to you and brilliant new features,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,It has been a long time setting up due to the number of features on it.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,its been a month since i bought it its very awsome and i loved it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"My old device broke down and I needed a new mobile fast. I was already interested in the Samsung Galaxy S9, so I decided on buying it. So far, I am finding this phone amazing. This is my first Samsung Device and I want to make sure it will last for at least more than 2 years.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Had my phone 8 days now, probably the best phone I've had.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,l up graded from s7 to s9 last week and I absolutely love it,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I've had this phone (upgraded from an S6) for about 2 weeks and I keep finding new features that make my life easier.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Brilliant Piece of machinery, normally I take a while to operate a new phone but not with this one, I was ""with it"" from day one, a magic phone and easy to operate, thank you Samsung!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Why remove the previous ability to assign personal sounds to contacts when receiving a text? Either it was an oversight or someone thought it would a good idea. Yet you add AR emoji. Emoji is a toy for children serving no practical point. When using this phone it was important to know who was messaging me so I did not have to look at the phone. I am considering ditching Samsung for a more practical thought out OS.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Awesome phone, exactly what I expect from Samsung. Love all the features and the look of it.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,I would advise everyone not to upgrade from the S8. Total waste of money for exactly the same phone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"Had it a week it's to small. Screen to tight system options at the bottom are frustratingly to close, third attempt at this message. The edge is glitchy when trying to press a button, they won't work. Camera good also smooth and fast. The s7 was the pinnacle of great design and I miss mine.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,"I bought this phone thinking great battery life, the charger cable wires are showing after a week of use.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I previously had a Samsung Galaxy s5 so this s9 has been a huge upgrade for me. I'm loving the camera and the stereo sound - this phone is so fast too. Still lots to discover but I would recommend one to anyone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,My first Android for nearly 10 years and it has been a very quick transition. Some apps aren't quite intuitive or responsive to swipe gestures (Instagram for example) and some text can get lost off the edge of the screen but overall an excellent phone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I absolutely love this phone the finger print scanners is much improved takes a great photo it's lighter than my old phone but I had the s8+ before and battery seems better and little faster than my old one .,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,I am struggling with it can't change tones for different emails a just getting about the phone I am strugleing,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Such a brilliant phone, looks amazing and does almost everything well. Bixby is rubbish in most areas and Google assistant is far better in everything that it does but Bixby does beat Google with a few extra features that Google assistant doesn't have. Overall the s9 is brilliant In almost every way the only real downside to it is the battery life is appaling",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"HAD FOR 2 WEEKS . FAB PHONE. NOT TOO SURE ABOUT BIXBY THO, NOT AS GOOD AS GOOGLE ASSIST",Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,Diference then s8 and s9 îs just a fingerprint and a better software nothingelse,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Been using around 2 weeks now, on the whole I'm happy. Hardware is great but one major bug bear is the notifications are terrible. I really need to be able to glance at my phone when notifications arrive. Sadly the screen does not auto wake which means I have to physically pick the phone up all day long, I waste a lot of my day trying to wake up my phone. Very frustrating. I'd also like to customise how the notifications appear, say ungrouped and more or less detail. Again, can't be done sadly.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,Love the camera and tge new fearyues on that with stickers slow motion. Also like the edge which is a quick hand access.. brilliant that I can add fingerprint and face id to open the phone... the biggest gripe is not being able to assign a different notification for different people in text ... used to know exactly who was texting...had to download another app which for this phone is ridiculous..,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I am still exploring since buying a week ago although battery life not as high,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I got the phone a few weeks ago and I've loved every little feature and detail the phone has it's all amazing from the screen and the camera to the sound quality and audio power.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Pros: Gorgeous - Great colour and build quality Feels great Amazing screen Great sound Fast Slick UI Great camera Plenty of features and customisable options Wireless charging/charge speed Cons: Bixby - Rarely wakes up regardless of how many times you calibrate. Love to use it and tried to persever but too inconsistent and not good enough yet. Battery - Despite the quality of the phone and the power it holds, the battery is still average, especially compared to other flagships Finger print sensor easily scratches despite proper care and caution. No support for blood pressure in UK Ar emoji isn't great - Despite being a selling point.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I bought the S9 as I lost my S7, the features are great I need to get use to using the phone, the only downside I would say is the battery charge it doesn't last as long as I would like it to, maybe I have to many apps running.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Finally switched from iPhone and will never look back!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,This phone is fantastic and the best phone on the market,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Beautiful to look at and to hold but my old s6 edge was smarter. Samsung you have taken a step back with the software. I want a phone that I can completely customise right down to the contacts and their text message notification. Which is something that I could do on my edge. Instead I am stuck with chosing one of your silly notification tones for everyone. Now I have to look at my phone to see if it's a text from my husband, my boss or a Twitter notification. Please sort this out and the phone will then have 5 stars. Camera is great, I used it in very low light and it was like recording in the day time. Battery is ok but then it's new. Time will tell on this one. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals are much stronger. Apart from the notifications I am rather pleased with my purchase",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Having had a Samsung Galaxy S6, there was no doubting that I would again upgrade to another Samsung smart phone. Transfering data from my S6 to the S9 was incredibly easy using the transfer function. Having had the S9 for over a month now, there is however several features that are missing on it. On the S6, the home button allowed quick access to the phone whereas the S9 requires to double tap the main screen and then the unlock swipe or even using the power button. This button feature on the S6 also allowed a double tap to instantly access the camera feature one which I really miss on the S9.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Most stylish,sleek phone I have ever had. Looks as good as it feels.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"The SMS texting/notification features are NOT the same from my S6. We used to be able to designate a different notification sound for each contact like we can do for ringtones for incoming calls. But with the S9 plus we CANNOT do this anymore. Is this feature ever gonna come back, some say it's due to the Oreo OS?. PLEASE look into bringing this feature back Please!!!! I almost want to go back to using my S6 Edge again because that feature was well worth it!!!! Thanks",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,bought this about 2 weeks ago think its the best phone i've ever owned,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,This phone has great functions and the quality is great,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,It's a really good phone however it is still expensive would have been great if the price difference between the S9 and S9+ could have been smaller that would have enticed me to buy the S9+ but all in all its a great phone. Battery life could be better and 6GB or RAM wouod have been nice also.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I've only had my S9 2 weeks I upgraded from the S6 and WOW what a phone I've set it up to what I like so far but the more I explore its features the more I change things. The security features are more than enough but I've added more bit of overkill I know but it's my phone. It's very sleek and has sexy curves nice and light for its size it processes things pretty fast so I'm impressed very impressed,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I've had to struggle with an iPhone for 12 months due to breaking my previous Andriod phone. This is a god send - and now I know WHY I loved Andriod.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Had the s9 for a few months after upgrading from the S7. Clear benefits to speed and bigger screen etc. Camera is better as well. I think there needs to be native support for changing what the bixby button does. I don't like having to download an app. Google assistant wins every time in terms of functionality in my opinion.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Coming from an iPhone, i thought the switch would be difficult, but since first opening the box I haven't looked back, everything about the phone is great, the camera, display, battery, just everything!! Very happy with the product, would highly recommend!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"The S9 looks good and performs very well, it's also very quick when using apps and social media Only issue I had was the difficulty in getting predictive text to work, I managed to go online and find a fix but it wasn't easy to do, I would expect in an update soon because I'm not the only one to have a problem with this important feature",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I have had the phone a week and have enjoyed exploring all the features. The only fault I can pick with the phone is the Bixby button placement, i frequently accidentally press it while handling the phone which gets a bit annoying when it comes on all the time when I don't need it to. Personally I would have preferred the Bixby button at the top of the phone but all in all am happy with everything else.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I changed from my usual HTC to the Samsung s9. The S9 is easy to use and is a far superior quality device. 10/10,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Actually think I preferred my s7 edge. Not a great deal of difference. Find the home and back buttons that have to swipe are irritating,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,So awesome love the iris scanner And camera is so much better,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Great phone, always loved samsung. My only. Issue is icon badges. The unread notifications badge dissappears from app icons when you swipe the notification away in the notification bar. Would be nice to still have the numbers on the apps so you know if you have unread emails for example. Other than that it's great!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Needs finger scanner on the front of phone but overall good phone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"I just upgraded from my S6 to the S9. While I am still learning the new phone, one thing I absolutely HATE about it is that you can't set custom text message notifications for your contacts. That's very important for me to have, enough so that if Samsung doesn't update the software and add that option soon, I will be returning this phone and going with an iPhone. I have never had one, only had Galaxy, but this option is a must for me. I need to know who is texting without dropping everything I am doing to look at the phone. Samsung PLEASE put this option back. It's ridiculous that you took it off. I know I can download another messaging app in order to have custom notifications, but I shouldn't have to do that. It was an option before and should be one now!!!! Please fix it, then I will leave a better review.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Bought it a few weeks ago to replace my old iPhone and it's miles better will for sure be sticking with Samsung/ android now.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Had the phone just over a week now after upgrading from the S7 edge. Generally happy with the phone everything works as it did on my previous model just slightly faster with better security features. The only disappointments were the super slow motion which is limited to very short durations which limits what you can capture. The other disappointment was finding out it is not compatible with my Samsung gear VR which I had recently purchased.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Samsung S9 love it... camera is simply fantastic... top notch bit of kit...,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Only had mine a week and i lv it. Had a iphone for the last 2 yrs..the camera is top . and way more free apps compared to itunes . i do still have my ipad which i do like .the s9 fits nicely in your hand ..only thing i would change is the bixby button and make it ya camera snap button..its in the perfect place to snap selfies. The button for quick camera snaps is volume which is higher. Thats when i find its not as good grip to snap selfies. .maybe samsung could move bixby to the right side and keep this button for qiuck selfie snaps .,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Owned the phone just over a week now. I have upgraded from the S6 Edge so it is a lot different. One thing I did notice is that it feels heavier than the S6, not a problem since the screen size is amazing! The technology and personalisation has increased a lot since then. I fully enjoy the different security options and the camera is exceptional! Although I still am mainly using the S6 for now whilst I still have it, I can't fully comment on the battery other than it has lasted 5 days with light use. I enjoy the phone a lot and excited to see how Samsung progresses with future Galaxy phones.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,A phone of this cost should be able to last a full day 12-13 hours without a top up charge,Very.co.uk

Bixby is great and I am still learning about the features. The camera is amazing and so easy to use. I love samsung products the technology if amazing all my phone's tv's tablets are samsung.

galaxy,4,"I bought this phone a couple weeks back after owning a Samsung Galaxy A3. Camera is awesome , speaker is awesome, the whole device is awesome. However, sometimes when scrolling on social media I find there are deadzones on the phone and it's as if my finger isn't on the screen so nothing moves. Also a bit disappointing you can't edit a video to go to slow motion , or a normal Slow Motion mode when capturing videos like iPhone have , Super Slow Mo is good fun but the focus square is too small so a bit disappointing. Other than the slow motion and deadzones the phone is brilliant.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"Just upgraded from S6 after 2 years due to performance issues. Pros: Awesome camera with cool features even in the dark! Size is similar to S6 so not wide. Usage of full screen is great esp for watching videos. Like the pull down options menu and the pull up apps menu Voice recognition works perfectly for me, especially in my texting app. Battery life is as expected for my usage. No better or worse than the S6. Speaker and microphone are top notch. Callers don't even know they're on speaker phone until they hear background noise. Charging cable plugs in the first time, every time. Like the edge tab. Very convenient. Was easy to transfer ALL my data and settings to new phone with included adapter. Can increase storage space with optional sd card. S6 didn't have that option. More settings to turn things on and off. I can turn off almost everything I don't like.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I've had this phone for 3 WEEKS now and I absolutely Love it. There is still so much that I need to explore. LOVE LOVE LOVE,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Great features, but let down by the battery. It can barely hold one day. The camera is very good, but not as consistent as my other Pixel 2.

galaxy,1,Bought the phone on 7Apr. Hate it! Bombarded with adverts. Advert on screen lock. Adverts stuck in my texts . Can't get rid. All it explains about is preference but not how to have no adverts at all. Stuck with this contract phone now,Very.co.uk

Which seems impossible, I just keep turning volume up and down. Phone battery gets really hot if playing games for more than ten minutes",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"None of my Bluetooth devices that paired with my S7 will pair with the S9. It seems the new 5.0 Bluetooth technology refuses to connect with Bluetooth 4.1. Samsung needs to put out an update to correct this situation. I have remote speakers, Samsung headset and Home Theater that are useless at this time. Had I known, I would have kept my S7. Buyer beware.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,I owned an S5 Samsung for many years and enjoyed the phone. I decided it was time for an up grade.so I went out and purchased the S9. I noticed that on my new S9 that the contact list font and the text font is way smaller then on the S5 which for me is quite annoying. I would hope that an up date is coming to fix it. Other then a few possible privacy issues that you can opt out of I am getting used to my new phone.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,"I could share my disappointment with the overlarge size of this phone, the lack of responsiveness on the touch screen, the inflated price, lack of hi def and the unbelievable amount of bloatware on it... But all of that pales compared to the disaster than is Bixby! Not only do I not want it, finding out that Samsung has dedicated a button to it that interferes with the volume buttons about half the time - adjust the button and here's Bixby telling you that you haven't yet set things up.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Had my samsung s9 4 about week now after patiently n excitedly awaitin it!....im less than impressed reminds me so much of the i phone which i detest...appears 2 have lost features that make a samsung a 'Samsung..feels like a copy cat i phone...oh how a miss ma s7 edge.:(...,Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,"Samsung has decided to block call recording without informing its consumers, therefore no app can record phone calls. As unbelievable as it is, this feature supposedly only works with Snapdragon variant, therefore I assume the phones for EU market as being sold faulty. Had I known that this feature doesn't work I wouldn't have bought this phone! Now I can't return it! Call recording is legal in the UK. In some countries it is illegal to record a phone call without obtaining permission, so as filming someone and yet Samsung has not blocked the camera!",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,Bixby doesnt fully understand me. The imogi selfie doesnt look anything like me. The spellcheck doesnt work properly and the predictive text isnt good. The fingerprint scanner doesnt always work even if my fingers and the scanner are clean... also dont like it being on the back of the phone as its quite an unnatural position to be in.

I can be running the fastest apps, open e-mail and browse without any noticeable lag. The quality of photos and shear range of options to improve and customize images is simply stunning. By far the best phone I've owned, wish I'd gotten the S9+ now with the extra screen real-estate... that's my only complaint; which isn't really a complaint. If you don't have this phone already, you need it in your life",Very.co.uk

Very good headphones with the phone and very easy to switch all my stuff from my old S7 to the new S9. The only issue I've found is the battery life is not great, I've found a bit disappointing to be honest. Battery barely lasts all day with standard use.

galaxy,3,Ive had this a wk and still cant get camera to work,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I've had the phone a few weeks and it is amazing. My main issues are battery life and Bixby. Battery life without power saving mode lasts 12 - 16 hours. For a phone of this price in 2018, it should last an entire day. Bixby is a pain, moreso the button - It's placement is awful but at least it can be disabled. The camera is absolutely stunning. Managed to take some fantastic low light videos and photos.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Only got this 5 days ago its better than an iphone as it does not frez easy to use,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,Overall I like it - I don't love it....,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Having Bixby is like having a young puppy it's hard to train and doesn't listen apart from that the phone is excellent,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Had an upgrade always used Samsung products and with phone devices never disappoints. Again absolutely lovely all the features are so easy to use and understand.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,Awful phone doesn't hold it's charge and takes ages to charge. Calls keep dropping out numerous times during a phone call it just goes silent it is so frustrating. I did have a Samsung S7 edge but traded it in for the Samsung S9 I have always had Samsung phones and never had a problem but can honestly say Unless this one gets sorted I will never buy a Samsung again.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Bought the phone a week ago and would never go back to iPhone now. The camera is great, screen size is great due to curved edges and the features are so smart - learning new tips every single day. Definitely recommend.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Better all around compare to S7 edge, like the design and performance",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I've had the phone for a week and I'm delighted with it. It is a quality product which does everything very well. The camera is especially good. The facial recognition is great. Most importantly it makes clear calls even when the signal is weak.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Only had this s9 for a week and I love it still not done everything on it yet,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Not happy with the price with eet and gone over 14 day cooling off period,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Got this recently & my friend liked it so got one too.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,Brought the phone last month and i fine the phone shuts the app im using and freezes,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Best phone out to date.. definitely sticking with samsungs,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Bought 2 weeks ago and so far it performs well, one negative is that it doesn't have the facility to assign individual message tone to contacts or to email!!! Update for that required Samsung!!!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had this phone for a month now. Had the s8 and loved it. This phone had some big boots to fill. It's done just that. Highly recommended,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I had note 8 which is bulky with many more features, but this S9 is much better",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I pre ordered this so received it early love it the camera is way better than the s8 it's more slender better features. I have had the s6 s7 and s8 and now s9 they are all brilliant phones in their own right but the s9 is the best. The phone is good on the eye and it would take something spectacular from Samsung now for me to part with the s9,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had my phone less than a week and I love it best phone out there forget iPhone get an s9 just brilliant,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I've had my for about a week now love the phone and the camera and layout and me and my family have had fun with the make your own emoji,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I am a Samsung girl through and through and I love my s9. The camera quality is amazing and the features on the phone are very clever. Only gripe I have is the battery life .... not great even after optimising apps etc. Inconvenient but manageable!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Purchased 2 weeks ago. Arrived on time, really easy set up and easy to use. I love it. Camera with slo mo is fantastic",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"This Phone is amazing the screen is out of this world, the phone has amazing features and the battery lasts all day, its a massive step up from my old phone S7",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"It does everything it should and a whole lot more. Really impressed with all the features, which all work well, unlike some other phones.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I had my galaxy s9 for about 3 weeks now and I am so pleased with it. Amazing camera on it and I also set up the Samsung pay.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"I bought the S9 256gb, expecting it to be great upgrade to my S7. The battery life is so poor that I have to switch most things that make this phone an upgrade, off.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"love my new phone, even better than the s7... great camera, user friendly, the only thing i think is rubbish is Bixby.. where is cortana",Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,"I bought this phone over a week ago, and im already missing my S7 edge. I buy samsung phones due to the fact they are great for playing music. I used to use google assistant on my S7 edge to control what i was playing on spotify which was great and then i heard about bixby. I purchased the phone purely for the fact it could control music, and when ive tried it its the worst thing imaginable to use. It only connects to google play (not even the sumsung music app). So for this reason i would not recommend it to anyone unless there is future updates to correct this issue",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Had the phone a week, so far I love it. Learning how to use the new features like Bixby.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Great phone , easy to use and camera is amazing I really recommend it",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Upgraded from s7 edge and got nothing but praise for the s9 it's definitely an iPhone beater,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"There’s no comparison, I’ve had Samsung phones for a long time now, and my S9 is exceptional, you can do so much, I love it.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Great camera. Photos hardly need touching up. Not too sure about Bixby. Why waste time on this feature when Google assist does all the same things. Handy for live translate but otherwise less interactive than Siri and Google. No need for the Bixby button. Just ends up unused and redundant Quick processor. No issues. Battery life lasts all day. But don't they all at first.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Amazing phone only drawback I bought outright accessories are very expensive,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Very good for all it does but it will not recognise my irises to set up that security feature. I'm also a little disappointed that a phone of this calibre does not have the ability to switch itself on when the alarm goes off like my previous non Samsung phone did. The most disappointing thing about the S9 is that it's basically the S8 with a better camera.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I bought this phone just over 2 weeks ago, and already I have to say I am disappointed with the battery life, and the fact it won't wireless charge with a good cover on",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Only had it a week but really enjoying this phone. Some great new features. Another triumph for Samsung.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I have only had my new phone for a week and I am so not disappointed, I was in love with my Galaxy S7 Edge and did not think it could be surpassed but Samsung have exceeded themselves yet again. My only disappointment is that I could not get the S9 plus, beyond my budget but second best is not always so bad..",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I have only had this new S9 just over a week but I am so pleased I upgraded. Samsung amaze me with their continued innovative technology.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I am happy with this phone, it is very well designed and serves its purpose.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Had it about two weeks and think it is a great phone but lacks the features you are paying for.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I absolutely love my S9. Definitely the best phone to have.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I'm very happy with this phone I will recommend to my friends,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Only had my S9 for a week but so far really pleased with it. Trying to get used to the camera, so many things to learn and understand. Tried super slow mo at a wedding yesterday which was good although took a while to get the box in the right place. Had an S6 before so a lot is similar and so far have found nothing which was better on the S6. Love the Edge feature, great addition.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I bought this phone about a week ago and it is amazing, couldn't ask for much more",Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,I am.not happy at all. I dropped this phone.on laminated flooring and the screen has cracked in the corner. Not amused,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had the phone a week and can't fault a thing about it. 100% the best phone I've had.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Best phone I have ever owned fantastic features fast internet access and great quality sound and photos,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Great phone in almost every aspect, flawlessly integrates into my life so I don't even need to think about it! Needs some improvements though: Battery life does not get me through the day, no native support for .m4a audio files is a real issue. Dropped from my pocket whilst stepping out of my car (only about 1-2') and left a deep scratch right in the middle of the screen, glass seems to be very soft. There's also a little lag occaisonally",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Bought this last Thursday an i dont regret it, features are amazing, network an plan are fantadtic",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Just had upgrade on my contract with EE and love it, but could not get access to my emails , so had to take it to my computer shop, and they did it, at a price! Now working well, and I am the envy of my grandchildren!",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Love this phone ...........,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,Only had a week still getting used to it. I will come back next week and rate again,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I'm so glad that I got a Samsung galaxy s9. Compared to my iPhone 6 it's a world apart. I'm a convert to Samsung.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I upgraded to the s9 as it has a great camera and lots of easy apps. Love it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I brought it 2 weeks ago, not fully explored it yet.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought this two weeks ago and am so pleased with features and phone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,When I scroll down Facebook the posts automatically play which is annoying,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had the phone just over a week now and so far so good. The only thing that is taking a bit of getting used to is having to hold the virtual button to open the screen which seems a bit hit and miss. Early days still so not used alot of the features as yet but working my way through them,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Owner this phone for a week and so far can't fault it. Great build quality, great features Bixby is really promising as a great assistant.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I bought this phone two weeks ago and I'm very happy with it, still learning how to use it but I'm slowly getting there",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I'm so pleased with my new phone it's a lot better than the J7,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Good quality.good picture quality, fast and self expranty",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Everything ok with phone apart from battery life it either over heats wen charging or the plug over heats after 10 minutes,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Happy with the phone although it would be better if there was an easier camera button for quick photos and videos.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I got an up grade last monday and love it i had the s7 edge samsung its better than iphone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Does things I didn't even realise I would like or need,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Iv had this phone for a week or so now All notifications were turned of completely with no clear Indication on how to turn them on. Great camera features. I'm not big on phones but I prefer the s6,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Bought the phone not long ago. The phone itself and the features are awesome. It's a shame my bank doenst work with samsung pay. I haven't had a good play with bixby yet but I will soon. Best phone I've had yet and the camera is awesome. I've two dogs and the slow motion and super slow mo are amazing and hilarious :D The only downside to the phone is that although the screen looks lovely, it's a huge pain in the behind as the device is so slim there's literally nothing to hold on to and I've already managed to crack the back when it literally slid out of my hand :( playing games is also difficult sometimes as part of my palm has touched the screen and it wouldn't register what my fingers were doing properly. But other than that the phone is great :)",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I received my S9 last week and overall it looks and feels great. I had a Samsung S6 previously and I appreciate the new features. Smart Select is so far my favourite feature given that it's not invasive on the screen and highly customisable. Overall I am happy with the purchase however there are few things I do not like. For example the inability to re-map the Bixby button to something else. I generally do not use voice interfaces and I would benefit from being able to map the Bixby button to something else. I also do not like the buttons toolbar at the bottom of the screen (apps, menu and back buttons) I find it very frustrating to have to keep locking/unlocking the button bar based on the app I use - I hope this gets better with future updates",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"Can't hear notifications because they are so quiet, this needs attention!! and the battery life being the same as the s7 is disappointing was expecting more.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,love it the best phone ever had. had sansung galaxy in the past this is by far the best,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I have only had it for a short while but already it's my favourite by far.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I've moved from a s6 to a s9 and there seems to be lots of new features to sus out irony feel like I'm making the most of the edge display with having a big rugged case maybe samsung should make a heavy duty ip rated case that works with the edge display,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Definite improvement on my S7 but nothing spectacular. The camera is good but I was expecting something amazing after all the hype.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I was going to buy the iphone 8 after always having an android phone.I am SO glad i diddnt.its a fantastic phone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had too get this my other broke after only 2yrs from new,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I recommend this phone, the screen is very clear and big so u can see it much better then my previous Samsung which was the s6 edge, I love the colour, it's shiny, I love the camera features takes amazing videos and pictures recently went too a concert and it looks like I was pretty much on stage It took amazing videos, I love the face detection features and has good storage space, does pretty much the same as any Samsung but it's worth it just for the camera if your into photography.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,It was given to me as a birthday present and I love it!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I bought this phone about 2 weeks ago and the performance of the phone is excellent so far I have had no problems. The camera is also excellent I no longer need a 4k camera in my bag anymore,Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,I bought this device 1 week ago whilst on holiday in Sydney but within 1 day I had to replace it as the face recognition security was not working. They had to replace my device. Now back in London - and the face recognizing ion has again failed!!!,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"It’s mint fam, way better than the iPhone, simply siiiick",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I bought my phone 3 weeks ago. I previously owned an iPhone and was very sceptical about switching however, I am so pleased I have. The Samsung s9 has an amazing camera, is easy and quick to use and has plenty of storage.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I've had s6 s7 s8 really good phones s9 is the perfect upgrade,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Always use a samsung, so pleased with this great updated version",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Loving it just what I been wanting cheers samsung.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Really good phone, very quick and screen quality is brilliant. Only annoying this is the Bixby button that I keep accidentally pressing when locking/unlocking the phone.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had my phone around a week now...best on the market without a doubt,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Has this phone for over a week now and I am extremely impressed. The combination of split screen and pop up size windows makes running multiple programmes and completing multiple tasks simultaneously effortless. The apps edge function just adds to this with anything you require quickly just one swipe away instead of going back to the home screen or minimising a tab. And Bixby is wonderful for those who like to take the effort out of everything. On Most phones this feature feels like just a bit of fancy showing off and commands are a bit hit and miss. But I regularly control my phone just using my voice and it's very accurate.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Really easy to get on with, camera options great just wish the super slow mo would record for a little bit longer. Glass is not as strong as my previous phone Xperia xa1 had for 6 months no scratches or anything no screen protector or case had this week and it has numerous scratches and scuffs on.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,Having used an s5 and s6 i find this phobe disappointing,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,"Had this phone less than a week. I'll keep this review short as typing is a nightmare on here but basically the screen has dead spaces meaning some actions are not registered. There are particular parts of the keyboard which have to be pressed various times before it works. Hoping this is a one off issue, as I'm exchanging my faulty phone for a new one shortly.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I am realky hapoy I changed over from iphone as there are so many free extras and advantages to my Samsung really nice phone and not too big or heavy very dainty and superb camera quality! Thanks .,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,It good to use. Once set up an security is inative,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,Bixby dont work fresh out the box. Let down. Waste of money.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Switched from another leading smartphone to the samsung s9 a couple of weeks ago and i am so happy i did! Excellent phone, no problems switching operating systems. The camera is amazing! The phone itself is so easy to use, i absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone thinking of buying one.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought this a couple of weeks ago and am smitten. Dual sim allows work and private to be there at the same time with Knox making sure work is protected. Multiple ways of getting the phone unlocked makes whatever you are doing so easy. Playing games is so easy and quick. Photos are amazing although I still need more practice at slow mo,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Bein using it for over 1 week now most of the time you push the center button to open the phone it vibrates but dosnt open,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Samsung just gets better and better, also it's so easy to use",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Brilliant phone, impressive camera, a little pricey.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Very good phone has many features ,and so simple to set up. Only downside battery life so far hasn’t been much to write home about",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I have had the phone 2 weeks and it has so many features the camera is brilliant with much more than my last phone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Stayed with Samsung again after my S7 contract ended. The S9 is worthy of the flagship title!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Just got this phone about a week ago so still getting used to it but it's eveything I would expect from a Samsung. The dual speaker is a good addition. Nice clear sound and vision and everything is where it normally is on the Galaxy and easy to find. I'll know better down the line but so far I'm really happy with the phone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Only had phone a week so still getting used to it.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"S9 has been great, the transfer from my old phone was easy (not Samsung) and this was one of my biggest fears when changing",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Phone is great but battery dosent last as long as my old s7 but over all a better phone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I got Samsung Galaxy s9 about a month a go and I would say that it is a grate phone but not the best cause they could have done so much more with it like imessage they could have fixed for Samsung and they could have done more display like iphone x and they could update all the apps with iriscanner like finger print ID verification,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Best .I was with 6S but this is amazing Used 1 months and I'm very happy.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Am happy for that I take lona for this phone and never change this s9,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,As before excellent phone would recommend this phone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I'm really enjoying the new Samsung galaxy 9 it fits my life perfectly.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Pnone is quite good, many functions, needs an app that converts itunes from mac to android phone, it seems nothing reliable about at present",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Nice feature: the iris recognition but can be improved; Battery - It is worst than my Samsung 7 edge Really dislike - the new charging port - why changing the usb type?? Features - similar to 7 version,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Not q fault with the hardware what so ever and the OS is as smooth as you could ask for. However one major floor is that my biometrically protected phone can be opened by anybody saying Ok Google. This is a major floor and allows anybody able to access your phone .,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Outstanding phone with some great features and build quality is excellent,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,"Whilst many manufacturers and designers strive to add value add features to retain customers (and add more) I was incredibly surprised to find that the ACR (automatic call record) app that I use extensively in business will not now function on the S9. I've had an S3,S4,S5,S6 all which worked perfectly, now the Samsung S9 wont support this. This was one of the prominent capabilities I purchase Samsung Android phones, and just can't understand in a world of adding functionality, this has been ""removed"" or locked out on capability. Samsung, I'm very disappointed. Has me now considering having two phones (using an older one in support) which is just nuts when ""upgrading"". Would not recommend Samsung S9 until this is fixed. Confirmed as a Samsung issue, not an app developer problem (well documented on web searches). Poor score as a result.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I have had it about two weeks. I have had a lot of fun emojiing all my family and do d the security on it easy to use.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Good except no good screen protectors and bad ar emoji,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Me and my wife have both up graded on s6's to the S9's. We've only had them a week so are still trying them out but up to now they seem very capable handsets.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"i bought this as an upgrade to my s6. The iris/facial scanner to open is a useful feature, although with my wet applied screen cover, it seems to take a moment longer to open. The main camera takes good low light pictures, however the front camera struggles to take a focused 'selfie focus' picture- leaving the face & eyes blurry.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I bought this a week or so ago I really love it and I have been constantly surprised by what it can do I would recommend the S9 to anyone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Love the pictures taken by camera. Driven crazy when trying to open the phone (too close,not close enough,eyes not open enough). Have been an iPhone user for many years and maybe I’m too old and too much of a tech thickie to make the change. Haven’t even began to scratch the surface of what it can do. My husband however adores his so I will learn to love mine.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I'm a samsung fan and love their phones me and my wife have the S9. So far so good no problems yet I guess with any phone they just take a little while to get used to and set everything up.

galaxy,2,"I bought this phone a few weeks ago, its all fantastic except for the fact that I'm lucky to get 3/4 of a day out of the battery, even when I'm not using it,what a let down. For the money it should last a lot longer",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Love this phone, it is faster then my S7 and the battery lasts so much longer then the S7 I had. The only thing I don't like is they did not put FM radio in it like I though they were.

galaxy,3,"Decent handset and the camera is good but that is the only really good thing about the phone, everything else is pretty much the same as every other phone I've had. Disappointed with the 'super slow-mo' as this only seems to work if something moves really quickly in the frame, rather than being able to film anything in super slow-mo. Overall a good phone but not necessarily any better than my previous S7.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I had a week now. Great features although still learning about some new features,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought this phone a week ago still learning but no regrets,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Easy to use and an excellent camera. Good screen and very flexible. Highly recommended.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I've bought this few weeks ago after looking for a small phone with a big screen. Beautiful vibrant screen and fantastic camera. Great design and feels and looks premium. All the complaints I had with S8 on S9 are addressed, for the first time the speakers are fairly good. Touchwiz is the only downside which is cumbersome and ""cartoonist"". It has improved vastly but the theming and customisation is very limited and has poor options. This is the major reason for it not being as popular as it should be. If more flatter and more ""iOS"" type of themes were available then it would be the best. This would appeal to more people. Fix your ui make it more iOS type smoothness and seamless. Also lose the bottom chin, less curve and that's it really S10 is a massive hit.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,So happy got this phone. Great speakers and camera. Learning how to use its many feature,Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,Got the s9 a week ago still getting round it but haveing a ball.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I have had this phone for just over a week it replaced an S7, the performance and features are fantastic as is the battery life.

I rate Galaxy S9 very highly and am so pleased I purchased it though there is still plenty of exploring to do. Would recommend highly.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Great photo options excellent resolution 128 gb would have been great,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"Got this the other day, not a bad phobe but personally i dont see what the hype is about.

galaxy,3,Only had the phone a week I'm really enjoying it. bixby though needs a bit of updatingas using the alarm feature reads the weather but doesn't read the news. doesn't wake up on command always and on par with Google assist lacking behind a bit.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought this phone a week ago and I'm enjoying it. I love Samsung galaxy phones.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I upgraded to this phone only just over a week ago, and so far I am very impressed! The screen is crystal clear, and the colours are amazing when taking pictures. I am also impressed with its water resitent qualities....only today I had the misfortune to drop it into the toilet (apologies for tmi)...however, I plucked it out and it was still working perfectly! I have always loved the Samsung handsets, so am very happy that this latest addition has lived up to my expectations.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I won my phone in a works competition and I love it....was always put off with curve screens as I didn't think I could protect the sides. Haven't even looked at all the features yet but i just think it's lovely. Great selfie filters. Fast charge is great (I bought a wireless charger doc for it) Will add more reviews once I have set up my own character and tried about the slow motion out.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Had phone a week, delighted with all feature available",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Got it over a week now and i still can't belive how good it is :D,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I bought this last week being an iPhone user since 2012 and young through there various models. My last phone was an iPhone 6s which is still a great phone but camera was becoming dated. I wanted a new phone with a better camera, customisable storage and bigger screen. The newer iPhones would have given me this but I could not stand the fact they took away the the auxillary connection. I want the option of wireless and wired and buying a new iPhone would have taken that option away and forcing me to another option. I have a great sound system that I connect to in the kitchen whereby I can watch sky sports with the aux connection. I decided to look around and started to feel myself looking at the s9 even more. I made the transition and after a couple of days of adjusting I must say I really like the phone. I love the camera, the speakers and more importantly the size. Has great features like optimisation and lookout. I love this phone and have not looked back. The one feature I would like to change is the way WhatsApp pictures go into the gallery. On the iPhone it is self contained in the app even though it uses your memory. Other than that I love this phone!!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,This is the best mobile I have ever used...I loved it's camera and dual SIM feature...,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Very easy to get used to after always having Samsung phones,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Was going to hold for a while before upgrading, but heard so much about the camera side of it that I couldn't resist it and bought my contract out to get it. Overall impressions it's a great phone and the camera doesn't disappoint, but still the battery on these modern phones need improving, after all you've got a mini PC in your pockets, browsing the web, keeping up with your social media, listening to you banging tunes and snapping away those moments you love. Surely technology needs to evolve to keep the phone powered for a greater length of time or more efficiently for the finger busy mobile users of today?",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Like it, except 'a' is difficult to use, requires far more pressure than the other letters, but I will get used to it.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Had the Galaxy S9 Edge for two weeks, I'm extremely impressed with the speed and quality of then phone. Easily the best phone Ive had. The screen is smaller than the S7 Edge. But the quality of the screen in far advanced to the S7 edge. I cant explain it but the slightly smaller screen is nicer and easier to use. The speed of all the updated apps is incredibly quick. I love the finger print scanner and Heart beat monitor. It has encouraged me to also take my blood pressure. I think this could potentially save my life at some point. I noticed my heart rate was too high this week and went to the doctor for a checkup and stress relief options. Thanks for looking after my health Samsung! :-)",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"I've only had the phone a couple of weeks but there is so much on here I'm still finding things. Some features are useless and hurt your eyes (changing the screen colour). The screen mirroring is great, although it could do with a little twerk. After watching for a few hours, it will be about 10 - 20 secs out of sync. So you have to turn off then turn back on again. Still yet to try my slow-mo camera. Maybe the weekend. Still trying it out",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought the phone knowing I would be truly satisfied with my purchase seen as i am an S8 owner too and I was pleasantly happy with that phone.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Only had this phone just over a week it has many features ( some I'm sure I have not discovered yet) another excellent piece of equipment from Samsung.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"Everything apart from battery (this is huge obstacle) and some software things (minor) is ok. But the battery performance is just very low. Phone hardly survives 12 hours of usage. It's Really crucial to charge it throughout the day. for the amount of money and since it's being compared to the iPhone X, I would expect more. Also battery saving modes are uneven. middle mode, saves just 15%, and the other one cuts everything off basically. Would not recommend for anyone who doesn't have an option for charging every now and then.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Had a iPhone previously really enjoying the change great phone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Overall the phone is very good but I have two gripes with the system. Facebook should not come as a system app and users should be able to install and uninstall it as they please not just 'disable' the fact that Facebook comes installed is ridiculous. Also when you turn the volume down all the way it goes into vibrate mode, I feel it would be a nice touch to be able to press down on volume one more time and have it enter silent mode without vibrations. This is how my old nexus 5x worked and I miss that capability because vibrate is annoying so I have had to switch it completely off all together instead of being able to toggle it easily. The value score is low because the phone was incredibly expensive",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I have had it for a week now and I don't like the society on it when I open my phone it keeps coming on the screen when I'm doing something with my phone,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,"Ive had the phone a week, a few features are dissapointing. Bixby never correctly hears what im saying even though i am a very clearly spoken british female. I find the new finger print scanner a little difficuilt to find quickly it is quicker to use a pin no. Camera quality looks the same as my s7 edge, also prefered having an actual button to return to home screen as the click in screen on the s9 is not always responsive. Despite all i do like the phone, just not happy with some of the features.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,I got a new phone as old one was dead due to dropping it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Why doesnt the slow mo work properly... never senses when somethong is in the frame...,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"Brought this phone over a week ago, Nothing special and tbh I preferred the s7. Nothing new to report really suppose better picture quality and thats that really. Doesn't do nothing more than my old phone S7, I hate it doesn't have a middle button, messages are harder to separate as in messenger and normal messages. The face recognition and fingerprint recognition is just annoying more than anything and half the time doesn't recognise my finger and I have to type in my security code. Save ya money and wait for something better to come out.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I bought when it first got released really good phone . Really good features . Only issue i have is the battery life isnt to long,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I am so pleased with my new phone. I have been a lifelong iOS user when it comes to phones, but a PC user when it comes to desktops. An android phone is so much more like using a PC than iOS. The amount of freedom and customisation with an Android phone is amazing and incomparable. Best decision I've made in ages. So many good games too. It's so enjoyable and user friendly, I was worried about the swap but got used to the new phone in no time. I love my S9!",Very.co.uk

galaxy,1,"Having had an iphone for a number of years I wanted a change, however I now regret this. I can't believe the phone doesn't support something as simple as spell checking or predictive text! I heard many good things about the phone - but I am yet to believe the hype! The more I use the phone the more I feel it's about advertising and selling me things! Everytime I look at my phone its telling me another app wants to check my phone, or reminds me to take a photo! Will go back to the shop and see if they can support me changing back.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I have had the phone for a week and finding new things on it daily,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"When I got my Galaxy S9 I thought that I would have to start over with my photos, because one of the photos is of my beloved late mum, which I use as a home screen, so I can see her every day. Within 10 minutes of transferring my phone numbers, and the rest of my information, I went to the home screen, and I was pleasantly surprised to see my mum looking back at me. The phone itself is just amazing, within 20 minutes I had everything I needed to get talking to my friends and other contacts, the screen is very clear, the keyboard is nicely spaced out for my clumsy fingers, even my location, and weather forecast is very clearly displayed without unlocking the phone. The Bluetooth function was easy to pair with my headphones, so I can listen to my music, or audible books, more importantly talk to people hands free while driving.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,I converted from an iPhone and so far only one regret: the battery seems to drain so much faster and seems to take longer to charge. And this is with mind battery savings mode permanently on. I'll see how it goes but it could be a deal breaker. Already decided against swapping iPad for s3 as reviews seem to indicate the same issue,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,I bought this phone as I wanted the latest one out. So far I love it but I was disappointed that you can not personalise a individual text tone to a contact. You need to set the same one for them all. The speed of the phone is a little slow. Love the new colour blue.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,Enjoying navigating my way round it! It's been quite a while since I got a new phone so from a galaxy A3 to the S9 is a big jump so a lot if new features to get used to!,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Still getting to know my S9. Some of the features are great, some a little confusing but it's early days. The picture and sound quality are amazing.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I absolutely love Samsung products but I’m not overly impressed with the Samsung S9. The phone it’s self is to similar to the S8 which is also a better price per month and upfront cost. Samsung are usually known for innovation and bringing something different to the market but they completely haven’t changed much on the new flagship. Notifications are annoying if you clear all notifications from the drop down it removed the dot from the actual app so if you don’t remember you will build up messages or notifications etc. Just clearing from the drop down should still leave the dot on the actual app itself. Out of 10 I would give it a 7. Overly priced S9 in a S8’s clothing.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had this phone for 8 days now absolute perfection makes apple products look from the stone ages,Very.co.uk

galaxy,2,Not good battery life at all. And get waaaaaay to hot whilst using and charging. Also takes an age to charge,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I have had the phone over a week now. Upgrade from the S8. I was a little disappointed at first as there was next to no difference over the S8. It even looks near enough identical to the S8. It does seem to take better pictures and seems to operate a slightly faster. I don't know if this is just me hoping to notice the changes. I still have the S8 and could compare the two. I don't fully get Bixby. I gave it a shot but found that it's bizarre to use. The internet search answers that it gives are no where near as good or as accurate as ok Google. Unfortunately I have gone back to using that. I think Bixby needs a lot more development. This sounds a very negative account of the S9. I would say I had the S7 before the S8. I preferred the size of the S7 if I am honest. But if you're going from an S7 or previous model then the upgrade would be fantastic and a big, noticeable, step up. The S8, however, is a fantastic phone anyway but in all honesty the S9 doesn't progress enough to warrant upgrading from the S8.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I still have much to learn to get the best from my S9. An operating manual with how to do things would be useful in addition to the user guide which tends to list what things do.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Got this phone as was due an upgrade. Phone isn't too different from the S7 so it's still easy to use. Love the hidden side bar for quick access to fave phone numbers/apps etc. Camera and new features are great. Love the slow mo and pro. Also fun that I can turn myself into a emoji. Bixby is also a great feature too.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Much lighter and brighter and faster. A great improvement,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I have gone from a s7 edge to a s9 and there are huge differences. I'm enjoying this phone and the camera is the best thing on it. I'm still getting to know it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"As a iPhone user for the past 10 years, I crossed to the dark side and got myself the new Samsung S9. It's absolutely fantastic and offers much more than my old Apple device. The camera is so clear. I'm definitely converted.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Bought it 3 weeks ago great phone excellent reception,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Upgraded my phone to the s9 and it is an awesome phone, not slow, great camera and looks great too",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,My previous phones were iPhones so I decided to change and I'm so glad I did. First thing I did was use the smart switch and it made the transfer of data so easy I was expecting a load of hassle but couldn't of been more simple connect the two phones together and let the S9 do the rest . I could rave on about all the other features but it would take hours so I will just say one thing AR Emoji .,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Good phone but to much going on with it only got it because I brought gear 3 watch,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Got this last week and it's quite possibly one of the best I've had. Easy to use. Love it,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"Excellent Phone, great features and relatively easy to get used to. Outstanding features and ease of access with using the Apps. Well done Samsung! Thank you so very much.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Love this phone, the camera is amazing and love bizby",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I brought this and was a bit sceptic about buying but after having the phone for over a week I am pleased to say that the phone is fantastic works great has an amazing camera,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Have my new S9 for two weeks now and I am really satisfied with it. Camera and features are awesome, enough memory space. It was really great purchase and definitely worth the money.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Bought that phone last week, always had iPhone before and I'm so glad I made the switch, so much better in every way",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Debated whether to get this or the iPhone x but glad I got this,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,"I gave back, as over heating. Had to put in fridge 3 times, to cool down",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I recently got the s9 absolutely love it, photos & videos are fantastic quality",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,For the last 9 or 10 years I have got Samsung phones but the S9 is more than just phone it's my whole life in my hand if I wasn't a fan of Samsung before this would definitely make me one it's so easy to use and just had so many features I can literally taliour it to my own needs I've only had it a couple of weeks and I love it I keep waited to find something about it I don't like as has been the case with previous S models but I don't good job x,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I really like this phone because had amazing features on it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,"I bought this phone 2 weeks ago, wish i had not. Prefer my Xperia xz",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Beautiful and great phone. However there isn't much difference from the s8.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Best decision ever! It's so customisable, the quality of the apps look great. I love the features such as the translation and the 2 apertures of the camera!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"This is the best phone. Great camera, amazing sound quality and it looks great. Thank you samsung",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Got my new Samsung galaxy s9 a week ago and I love it.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Got the s9 a week ago moving from the galaxy s7 edge. I was sceptical about the move but honestly haven't moved back, one of my main problems with the s7edge was the storage at only 32 gb whilst the s9has 64 which is much better. Overall great phone, great features! Very happy",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I used to have an iPhone for years but I got bored with it and fancied a change. I'm so glad I selected the Samsung S9. It's been great. I'm still learning new things about it even now so I think I'm going to stick with Samsung from now on.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Same size battery as S8 and S7 but lasts up to a week on standby great battery life,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Not different from the one I traded in. A bit disappointed with the battery life.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought the Samsung S9 just over a week ago. And I think it is a amazing phone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I bought this phone 10 days ago. Couldn't believe what this phone can do. Amazing camera. Very pleased.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I have the phone two weeks and is great I'm very happy,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,The back button is very annoying I It sticks and it difficult to use,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,I am goof with the pictures slow mo features and storage . But i notice that there has been a delay facebook messenger notification if the person is calling me . I always miss the calls because it doesnt notify me immediately and the speaker has this kind of bleepy sound while ongoing vid call i dunno why .,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,Husband got me my new phone on the same network I was already on... Only one problem is signal drops out....,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"This phone is great in many ways. The new camera technology is a huge improvement. Huawei can throw in 100mp camera into their phones and it still won't be a competitor. The stereo speakers sounds beautiful. The main gripe I have is with the design of the phone, don't get me wrong it's an attractive design that feels good in the hand. What I can't understand is why the phone is so much heavier and thicker than the S8? It has the same 3000 mah battery! Even the S7 Edge has a 3600 mah battery and weighs less than S9, while keeping that sexy sleek thin design that I love. For me that is a deal breaker because it doesn't feel as comfortable to hold, especially once you put a case on. Another thing I'm not so pleased with is, what's up with the extra long phone? No real point to have a long screen, we will be scrolling down or up either way lol and that gives us that weird 18:9 ratio. I feel like Samsung did the best job on the S6 edge when it comes to overall specifications of the design with it being much lighter, thinner, etc.. but if that stuff doesn't bother you as it did for me by all means this is the best phone to buy on the market right now and you should buy it.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"Really happy with the device so far. Coming from the S8 it is pretty similar, but faster. Love all the new camera features, great fun with the kids! Not Many issues, although I have noticed when on a call the proximity sensor can be a bit temperamental as the screen can turn off and on quickly when you lift the phone away to use the key pad. Media volume is lower than the S8, I have found I often need to turn it up to full to hear some videos. Overall the phone is brilliant, by far the best available today.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Had this phone for a week and love it. The camera is amazing and still learning to get the best out of it. Love the biometrics security. Haven't found anything I don't like yet.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I got the this 2 week ago and I'm so happy, it looks great it's nice and slim. Feels good to hold. The features are fantastic.only slight criticism is the self emoji isn't fantastic but good for a laugh and a bit of fun",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Damaged my s7 edge. So bought s9 on the day it was released. Miss my s7 but with the s9 i'm happy with my new phone,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Decided my Samsung s7 was needing to be upgraded. So opted to buy a simless unlocked s9 as the features looked amazing. Only had a week but loving it.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,Had it a week or so. Bixby is unusable. It’s not really for grown ups. Hybrid sim functions well. Screen isn’t that responsive.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I wasn't sure how the s9 differed from the s8, I had the s7 and was due an upgrade. The price put me off but I have no regrets. This is the best, the sound quality is amazing, the new camera is like having Snapchat without the need for the app. I really like it. No regrets",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Excellent phone gadgets great only down9is reception not as good as my I phone 5 I've just got rid of,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,bought last week...upgraded from s8 plus. it's ok so far. the camera is brilliant! love the new features. The edge lighting seems better than on the s8 plus BUT still you can't choose colours to contacts like the s7 edge...battery runs down fairly quick without much use either. no difference in screen quality that I can tell. the iris and face recognition are much more accuarate which is a bonus....just hope this phone doesn't get screen burn like my s8 plus and s7 edge did.....,Very.co.uk
galaxy,1,"Phone screen gave up after 3 days,not the quality you expect from Samsung",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Had the s9 for a few weeks now and it's the best phone I have ever had, and the camera is amazing",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Phone is light weight and easy to handle. Camera is really good and has the slow and fast modes. The charger connection is not a mini usb as it is slightly bigger but you get a converter as well as the new size charger so can still use mini usb if you have old chargers. Would highly recommend.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,2,I bought this phone a month ago I nearly did a somersault back in to the shop and swapped it for a i phone. I mainly bought it for the slow mo camera which I havent discovered yet.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Only had the phone a week, still learning but really impressed so far",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Bought my s9 as an upgrade and thrilled with it. Responds so much better than the s8. Face recognition and finger print works a lot better than previous models. Taken fab videos with the camera and they are really clear and the sound has improved as well. Love this phone!,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I'm very happy .... nice phone quick access to all app,Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,I havent explored everything but seems good. I havent really used bixsby but i am guessing it will be useless like on the s8.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"I bought this last week and everything seems to be as expected. The only reason I gave it a 4* is that the battery drains very quickly. I have used s7,S5 and S3 before and none of them had this problem when purchased.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Only had a week and loving it. Great phone glad I changed from iphone.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,"This is probably the least enthusiastic I've been about a new Galaxy phone. It doesn't live up to the hype, in my opinion. Functions as a mobile should, so I guess I should be content with that, even though I'm salty about the sound quality and the fact I cannot listen to music on this device.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,Annoying finger print on the camera lenses instead of on the front like the s7 stuttering when typing screen shot end up pressing the bigsy button or what ever it's called just nothing special apart from the camera has greatly improved even worse ring tones then ever before,Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,I bought this phone one week ago and love it so much,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Samsung just keeps getting better and better. My last 2 have been samsungs and the s4 was awful, then the s6 was a vast improvement however that died just under the 2 years. Im hoping that the s9 will beat eveything and then some. It is fast and responsive, voice recognition is excellent as is the iris and face unlocking.battery life seems very good so far and the wireless charging means that if you put the s9 in an enclosed waterproof case the charging port keeps fluff free for nor al use. The new charging cable has got rid of the micro usb and now has a cable that can be plugged in either way around just like its main competetion. Well done Samsung.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"I got this as part of a contract upgrade, exchanged my old S7 Edge. Excellent upgrade some of the new features made it worthwhile and the phone has evolved a bit in two years. Very responsive, biometrics are great, transfer of data from old phone is simple - but beware a few things need to be backed up in app, such as WhatsApp - Bixby is actually quite good, better than I expected not sure if I will use long term but is good, battery life has not been great - getting less than a day on fairly moderate use, may get better when battery has bedded in but has been over 10 days now.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I didn't think I'd ever have a Samsung again but the S9 is just so pretty and they have made massive improvements over the years. I'm very happy with the quality of the screen and camera and how fast things load.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,"Great features and very fast in compared to my s5 which is still going, but I thought I'd treat myself after 4years. Only moan is the call quality cuts out when switching from Wifi to mobile which is a bit annoying hench the 4 star rating",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,It does everything I expected and more apart from making a cup of tea.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I bought this phone almost a month ago. The phone is fast and camera is really good. Only reason i gave 4* and not 5* is due to it not having a button.,Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,Got this phone on pre order. Phone is great and the camera is amazing. Down side is your not able to change the text size on text messages. So hard to see if your eyes are not the best. The s8 you could adjust the text font size. But you cannot do this on the s9. A very disappointing freatur that Samsung has seemed to have missed. Hopefully they will fix this with an update. But they haven't so far,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I w says have Samsung Galaxy phones and was excited to upgrate from my S7. I have not been disappointed,Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,I bought this 3 weeks ago and wprk perfect.new design and easy to work on him.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,3,"Having been an avid Samsung fan since the beginning I have found myself disappointed,not with the phone features as such more to do with the design. Firstly I don’t like the edge,it’s just a personal thing as glass screen protectors don’t fit well but the main problem being I sorely miss the ‘home’ button,I think this is a major design flaw. My husband has the Note 8 and is of the same opinion,especially when a 4 year old is playing games or using any apps. I miss it so much that I am considering changing to iPhone or at the very least going back to a more basic model like my old Samsung Galaxy S6! I also don’t like the look of the new design with the front all black,it needs a ‘rim’ so that in looks in sync with the rear of the phone..all just my opinion!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Upgraded from S8 and although it does feel a tad like ""A S8 MK2"" still an absolute pleasure go use. No lag, seamless performance and camera even better! It will take a lot to replace this phone as NO.1 in the world at the moment in the flagship smartphone marketplace IMO.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,This is rhe best phone ive ever purchased iam very pleased with it,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I moved from an S7 edge to the S9. The S9 is so much faster to use and the screen resolution is stunning,Very.co.uk
galaxy,2,"Got the phone a week after its release, data probelms, software problems for 3 days. Now blind spots on the screen, keys miss typing a regularity. Most words spelt wrong as sock of having to constantlyb re type everything.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,Bought it 2 weeks a go and i can say theres no issues,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,I got 1 week ago best phone ive had features are brilliant,Very.co.uk
galaxy,4,I mainly bought this phone because it was one of the smallest on the current market but it is still a little big. It's quite a nice phone. Not spectacular. Just like an s8 with a few extra gimics that you will use once. Nothing is straight forward about a Samsung and there are still some things that are stumping my friends and I for hours even though they all have Samsung's too. The screen is nice and clear and I have enjoyed using the heart rate monitor.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Only has it a week. Love the great photos and videos.,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I love my phone. It is truly a stylish, good looking phone that performs really well. Samsung has done so well. All the new features are great and I recommend just getting to know what it is capable of and personalising it. I love Bixby as you can tailormake train it. This is a phone that makes you want to use it. The screen and camera are excellent. The volume and sound is top notch. I bought a Samsung cover for the first time as I truly want to protect my constant companion.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,5,"I did pre-order and Samsung delivered the phone on time. It was very quick to transfer files from old phone to Samsung S9. After using the phone for a week now, I can tell this is my best phone by far. The image results are pretty sharp even in the low light condition. As for indoor pictures, I used the camera's flash and the result is pretty good. The app works awesomely too - I use Samsung Health Management app on daily basis, and so far so good, I use Samsung app to record my sport activities and heart measurement (by placing your fingers on the sensors). I haven't checked how the sensor works on stress level though. The speaker is great and very clear. Lastly, of course, the design is smart, flashy and charming. My previous phone was Samsung edge and I adore the design of Samsung edge, I am glad the Samsung S9 has the smart edge design as well, only this time is way better looking - less wider. Plus, I like the Always on Display Option - a fast way to check the phone without sliding it.",Very.co.uk

galaxy,4,Had this phone for 1 week and I love it but wish the battery lasted longer,Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"Coming from the S7, this was a leap forward with a larger screen, faster everything, larger/better/ brighter display, powerful features. Samsung made it easy to transfer everything I chose to transfer from the old phone. The S9 uses a USB-C connection so I'm having to order new charging cables for car and work. The S7 charger works though, just not the cables. The sound on the S9 has greatly improved. Can actually hear things in music that I never could on the S7 via speakers. The only issues I've come across thus far is the ability to assign a specific SMS tone to certain individuals. So far, all I see is the ability to set a ringtone and the default notification tone is always used for SMS. Got the phone yesterday. Woke up this morning and it had a software update waiting. Samsung is a step ahead. Using this on Verizon. Just swapped SIM from old S7 to the S9 and worked like a charm.",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"I am falling in love with my new S9. Beautiful display fast and responsive. I got the lilac and its really fantastic in appearance. The view-thru case is a real plus as well. Samsung made the linking and transfer of my old materials on the S6 easy and complete. It charges fast even in the US. My only issues were FED-EX delivered it to the wrong address so it took me 5 hours to find it after it was delivered. And the wrong SIM card was included. Thanks Samsung, this is a beautiful device!",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,Am very pleased with this. Even delivered earlier than expected. Well done Very,Very.co.uk

galaxy,2,I got my pre order S9 last Friday and have been nothing but amazed by it. The speed of the processor is brilliant. Ease of use from iris unlocking to smart sign in. It just feels like the S9 is very much the next generation. Even the look of the phone compared to others is just great. I came from an S6 but also use other phones for work and this just is simply the best phone I've ever seen or heard. Sound quality from the AKG headphones is lovely crisp and clear.

galaxy,4,"Just upgraded my phone, so far I am happy with what I have [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Very.co.uk
galaxy,5,"The S9 builds on the already excellent S8 by improving the camera even more, improving the iris/face unlock by combining the two methods into one, and most dramatically by including stereo speakers on the phone, providing a much more immersive audio experience while watching videos. Combine that with the lightning fast processor and incredible sAMOLED screen and you get yourself a very, very solid phone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Very.co.uk

galaxy,3,Just got this phone last friday 7th of Dec. Haven't been able to truly enjoy it because of having to deal with bixby. I have been told by samsung that it is an important part of the S9. The bixby home button is too close to the volume control. just like on the S8. I have no need for bixby. And,vw
galaxy,4,"First of all, I'll address some of the common negative reviews about the Galaxy S9 and how to fix those issues.

I would have given it 5 stars, but my phone keeps dinging (notifications) even though I have gone through all of the systems and turned off all notifications except text messages. The other thing that bugs me is, that they have changed the charging port size, and only included a USB adapter and 1 wall charger. So now none of my car chargers (or other wall chargers) will fit, so if I go anywhere I have to remember to also make sure to grab my only cord. It would've been much better if Samsung would've included an adapter, (not just a USB adapter). I also love the smaller size S9 as opposed to the S9+, as I have arthritic hands. (Is approx the same width as the S6, but a little longer (top to bottom) than the S6.",att.com
galaxy,3,This phone is great except that it doesn't have the mobile data quick setting like come on now this phone has so many great features and yet it doesn't have a easy and fast way to turn off my data ...apple has that why can't we,att.com
galaxy,4,"The Samsung S9 is a good phone. I like that even with a life proof cover it still will fit in my Carhartt thigh side pocket. One problem that I do have is the edge screen is difficult to click on somethings with the cover on it. But as expensive as the phone is I would not use it with out a cover. I seem to get better battery time with the S9 than I did with my old S7. Over all I like the phone but some of the changes, such as Bixby, is a waste and some of the apps I was using with my S7 don't work as well or don't work with the new OS. The cost and some of the software changes make it a negative. But the battery life is good and over all it is a big upgrade from a S7 to a S9.",att.com
galaxy,3,"To start w the Pros: ** great battery life ** camera decent (nothing extra special) ** small compact.. great for those who dont like the huge phones
Cons: ** keyboard is not as user friendly (only one keyboard option) ** Bixby voice recognition is worse than Googles, so usually have to type everything in. ** If you use the messages app.. u will have to share the same notification tone as all other apps (the option in messages to change the notification tone doesnt work) ** Theres no way to have a different message tone per contact (it has been taken away) ** In order to get the 2 options above u have to use a 3rd party app like Textra. ** The Caller ID Name is not available on the S9.",att.com
galaxy,4,"The phone performs faster than my galaxy s4 was performing. I am very disappointed about the little features that I liked on my previous phone, though. The messaging app does not allow for customization of colors, background, or notification sounds. I was worried that this phone would be too big for my hand like the galaxy s3 was, but it is slim enough that I can hold it with my small hands. I do not like the Bixby and as soon as I figure out how to turn it off, I will. I do like the pink Icon package that I was able to download. All in all, I am glad I have the new phone. Just wish I could customize my little message app.",att.com
galaxy,4,"Very pretty. All the coolest stuff. But I’m ticked off. The phone is silly slippery. I avoided using it until my case arrived. I dropped it so many times, I lost count. Furthermore, my fingers slid across the screen and I ended up tapping the wrong things constantly.
The fingerprint used to be on the front, and it was really convenient — worked well with the thumb naturally there. Now it’s on the back near the camera lens. Without the case, it’s a joke. Don’t even bother trying to use the phone without a case. It’s a nightmare.
Sadly, I will not return this phone, even though I’m really ticked off. Why? Simple....because it’s the best darn phone out there, with the very best features, and it works seamlessly. Full stop.",att.com
galaxy,5,My phone of choice was the iPhone. I've had just about every model. Until apple decided to slow my SE down (it would reboot 3 times daily) I never thought about changing. I'm extremely glad I did. I like my Galaxy S9. Google music converted all my iTunes songs so I didn't lose a thing. I'm still getting used to the phone but it's a fun journey. I can honestly say that I won't be going back to the iPhone.,att.com
galaxy,3,"The S9 is nice and sleek, but I'm unimpressed with some of the functions that are now gone. My previous phone was a Galaxy S5, so I don't know when they changed the charger, and removed some of the convenient texting functions, such as a box to check or uncheck when sending a group text so you could opt out of keeping it a group text but still send the message to everyone at once. I find there are more clicks you have to go through to accomplish small tasks such as setting alarms, and changing volume settings than previously. The are functions now missing or more complicated, such as adding a number to contacts from texts. I'm not a fan. If you want your phone to function more like an IPhone, you'll love the S9, but if you're a Galaxy fan, be prepared to do a lot more searching for things that were much more convenient previously.",att.com
galaxy,1,"I replaced an s6 with this phone because it was low on memory (only 16 mg) but this S9 does not do all that the old phone would do. I does not mirror image with my samsung smart tv. It does not have a remote for the Samsung TV. But more importantly, it drops the network and so I do not get calls or texts and cannot get calls or texts when this happens. I only find out this has happened when I try to call and it will not make a call or text. Then I worry, what did I miss. I use this phone for work. Sometimes It will start working again if I restart it but sometimes I have to take it in for service and get a new sim card and have the VPN settings reset. Last time I had them teach me to redo the settings. I would not get this expensive phone again.",att.com
galaxy,4,"I had a Samsung S5 and the screen started doing weird things so time for a new phone. The Galaxy S9 was just coming out and decided to pre order it. Screen is much clearer than what I was use to and had to get use to the wrap around screen. Seems to make it more touchy but a case solved that problem. Phone calls are much clearer and easier to understand and hear callers on speaker phone. The only negative I can see so far is the ability to send pictures by text or email. My other phone was super easy to do and easy to remember but it seems to take a little thought to do the new one. Overall I’m pleased with the phone and hope that I can get as many years out of this one, like my last phone. My husband always says his iPhone is far superior but I get better reception, more bars and better pictures with my phone and we’re with the same carrier. I’m staying with Samsung,",att.com

So far, very pleased.",att.com

The only thing I am starting to dislike is that I have to type harder for the phone to sense it. I'm still getting used to it so my spelling is terrible most of the time.",att.com

Sure a little more complex than the iPhone, but once you get the hang of it its smooth sailing from there!",att.com
galaxy,5,"So far I've been using my new Samsung Galaxy S9 for about 5 days now, heavy use each day. It's still a little early but I have no major complaints about it. It's definitely a step up from my old Galaxy S6 Active. I'd still have my old S6 but the digitizer was dying a slow painful death and I had to upgrade right away. The S9 is much faster (but not quite as fast as the European version's processor). It's easy to learn if you are already a previous Samsung owner. Bixby still needs a little work, but useful still. The camera works flawlessly and has some awesome features. Sound from the both bottom and top firing speakers is a superb improvement over previous Samsung galaxy models. Switching to the new S9 from my S6 was easy as could be in terms of transferring all my apps, photos, contacts, etc. Previous times I had to install the mobile transfer app but not with the S9. During setup I was given the option to connect my old phone with the new S9 via the supplied cable and adapter. The entire transfer took about 30 minutes and I lost absolutely NOTHING from my old phone (including my call history, texts, photos, videos, music, memos, etc!)... Battery life is acceptable and I get a full day out of it with heavy usage, much better than my old S6. The fingerprint scanner is quick and simple to unlock the phone and in a much better location than on older models. I tried fooling it several times but couldn't. It seems pretty sturdy too - I've dropped it twice, once on a tile floor, once on concrete from waist level with no damage to it (I do have a thin cover/case on it.) Overall I'm impressed with the phone and happy with my decision to upgrade to the S9.",att.com
galaxy,1,Do not get this phone if you enjoyed the basic features of your older galaxy phones. Will be returning this to ATT today and just going back to my older galaxy edge phone. So many unnecessary Samsung specific programs and apps and the Bixby button is just plain frustrating. DO NOT GET,att.com
galaxy,3,"I recently upgraded from the s7 active, to the s9. What a difference. The sensitivity of the screen out of wack. Some spots wouldn't respond at all, and others spots would just go haywire without me touching it at all. I took it into the AT&T store and the tech guy said that people had been having the same type of issues a lot lately. He swapped out the phone for me and so far everything has been okay with this one. A friend of mine went through exactly the same thing with her s9 plus. Be cautious when choosing your next phone.",att.com
galaxy,5,"I have only purchased Galaxy phones , but this one is by far the best one yet. The display is clear, the options available are great, and the ease of transition from the S7 to the S9 was perfect.",att.com
galaxy,5,"This phone is awesome. You need to use a nice case though. Which is no problem. Once I put the shock proof case on it, it has the same feel of my older S5 Active . The buttons aren't as sensitive as my old phone so I don't activate stuff putting it in my pocket. The buttons on the face are set in the touch screen so they aren't depressed by mistake either. I really don't understand all the negative reviews! But some people just need to complain about anything. Buy this phone.",att.com
galaxy,5,"I was skeptical of the tall design at first, but you are able to make the notifications pull down by checking an option that lets them come down anytime you drag down on the homescreen no matter where your finger is on it, so you don't have to go all the way to the top of the phone. After you figure that out you get to use the full length of the screen to read even more of a webpage or a text etc, which is nice.
The performance is great, the battery life is pretty good. The screen is curved just like the s6/7 edge and glass screen protectors like to pop up/off when a case presses against the sides of it. You can either get a plastic protector or there are a few glass protectors that have adhesive you apply before putting the screen on. Of course your luck will vary, some cases don't press on the screen protectors like others.
The iris/face scanner is really nice. I don't know how but the iris scanner even works in pitch black darkness. This means you have a face/iris/finger/code to unlock your device so one way or another you can unlock it.
Oh and I forgot to mention the most significant thing. Because it is tall and not wide, this somehow makes it the perfect width for texting. I text with one thumb and I've never had a phone that texts as good as this one. The keys are the perfect spacing and when I initially started texting I noticed I wasn't making any mistakes, at all. My thumb was hitting everything perfectly. On wider/bigger phones you have to stretch your thumb to some keys and it just creates an inaccurate experience. No such problem on this phone, it is a texting dream.
It also has a blood pressure sensor in it, but you have to google to get the right app to do it.
Overall I'm very impressed. If I had 1 thing to complain about it would be the curved screen. I know they want to give it a sort of *infinity* edge screen but it doesn't seem to gain you anything and hitting a button that is on the very edge can be somewhat less sensitive than the main part of the screen, but this is very minor and barely ever noticed. It is a great phone. Get the edge 24 month as it is the best deal and get a new phone every year.",att.com

galaxy,5,"I've been a Apply user since the Iphone 4. I recently upgraded from the 7 plus and I just didn't like how Apple slowed my battery down so much and the fact the got rid of the headset jack. I was a little intimidated to change over to Samsung, but man I'm loving this S9!! Its way more advanced and customizable and it really helps in my everyday life. Especially as a manager. So far I couldn't be happier with this phone. I'm not trying to say that Apple doesn't make a great phone, because they do. But this Samsung fits my needs to a capital T.

galaxy,5,I am basically the Murphy's Law when it comes to phones. I completely destroyed my phone to the point the screen was glitching. I was able to upgrade to the Galaxy S9 with no problem.

galaxy,5,My husband dropped his old phone and cracked the screen. Since we were due for an upgrade we dealt with a super sales rep who offered a a sweet deal on this phone.

It’s very pretty and he loves it. He set up the retinal scan on his phone right away and it’s amazing. He doesn’t have to have the phone at eye level or anything but it always knows if he’s the one holding it. It gives you 15 tries to unlock the phone before you get locked out of it and have to factory reset which he feels good about incase it ever gets lost or stolen.,att.com

My iPhone 6 was a great phone.... that is until Apple decided to throttle it to force me to upgrade. In a way, they won. But in forcing me over the edge to upgrade, they revealed their shoddy business strategies and their anti-consumer attitude. That attitude made me look at Samsung again, and I knew I had made my decision. The Samsung Galaxy S9 is a wonderful, fast, and complete device that I believe is worth every penny. Thank you, Samsung.",att.com

I was skeptical at first but the video and camera take the best pics I've seen on any smartphone. The weight of the phone is a little bit more but for me I really like the additional weight, feels great in the hand. My little girl has tested the water submersion feature when we were at the pool and had to swim 10feet to get it, and works just fine! Overall, it's definitely an upgrade from the S8. I almost forgot to mention the finger sensor! It's actually located in the middle, right below the camera this time! I think the S8s biggest flaw was the location of the sensor which was NOT in the middle and offset to leftof the camera. It took some time for my finger to actually get accustomed to the location and not touch the camera lens itself.",att.com

galaxy,1,"This phone is under 3 months old. It worked fine for about 3 weeks then started to act up. It defaults to a White Screen and takes you to the Home screen while you are viewing email or text msg or app's imbedded. Samsung blames the carrier, the carrier blames the manufacturer and the stores 'Squad' blames 3rd party apps. All play store apps have been removed and still it fails. I had an iPhone 5S that worked well and was excited to upgrade. I have been sorely disappointed and very angry that no one wants to own up to a bad phone. See YouTube offering below. Now it appears my phone does this everywhere and AT&T is sending a tech to my house even though I told them this happens everywhere. This problem seems to be an systemic problem with AT&T's Mobile phone service and they definitely don't want to hear that. Search for 'Galaxy S9 Failure on YouTube to view the shutdown that occurs.",att.com

The settings are easy to find and easy to search for. The features are endless, so just look up stuff like best S9 apps, and that sort of thing, and you'll find great stuff. I MUST mention the handiest app I found - Xender - which transfers large files wirelessly phone-to-phone and best of all, phone-to-computer (or the other way around), with no cables or data usage. I recommend the Otterbox Defender case for this phone. Mix the toughness specs on this phone with that Otterbox, and you'll get mind-blowing protection; even better than the old AT&T Samsung Active series. Overall, I'm SO glad I got this phone. We took advantage of a BOGO offer when we added a line to our account. So, at half the price -WHAT A DEAL! ;^)",att.com
galaxy,1,Its a really bad phone the cameras ok but the sumer slow motion is terible. The phone has so many glitches like when im watching YouTube it leaves the app without me touching the screen. And i cant take videos because it randomly stops them. I had this phone for a little over 3 months and i already need a new one. I think i might go back to my i phone 4 because that thing works better than the s9.,att.com
galaxy,1,I have had my galaxy s9 for 7 months and the contacts app keeps force closing constantly. Took my phone to my network provider and they did troubleshooting for 2 hours before factory resetting it. Less than 24 hours later and it’s doing it again!! Except now I can’t even answer calls it says “calls has failed” ridiculous! The only good thing is the camera. Which is all mine is good for right now!,att.com
galaxy,1,"My phone turns on and off throughout the day, this is the 3rd one I’ve had each with different problems. Samsung has had a lot of problems for me no matter which one I’ve tried, I’m extremely unhappy.",att.com
galaxy,3,"Its okay, still getting use to it...I sorta wish it was larger since I am getting older I like more view. Clear and quicker. Don't like all the apps downloaded already and Bixty is annoys me.",att.com
galaxy,2,"I have had this phone for 4 months, and it has recently started booting me back to the home screen while watching videos. While playing music over bluetooth audio will cut out periodically. Voice to text software is way behind my old s7, messes up everything when it doesnt say ""voice input unavailable."" Not a good experience and in the future I will not be buying any samsung phones",att.com
galaxy,3,"The new Samsung S9 is nice, fast, sleek, and has a long battery life, but the memory just isnt' enough. I'm a systems power user, I use my phone for computing, remote access, etc and I have certain apps that need the memory. Most phones have 6gigs / 128gig like Asus. If you're into Samsung this phone is great but I'm going to return it and keep with Asus. Oh, and no apple ever.",att.com
galaxy,3,"Last fall I replaced my S7 with the S9. While the S9 has nice features, like more space and improved camera, I can't get past losing the dedicated buttons on the bottom of the screen. The three sliding buttons are sometimes visible and sometimes become visible when the bottom is swiped up. It takes two actions (swipe and select) to do the same thing a dedicated button did with one touch. Also, the three buttons appear and disappear unexpectedly at times, and wrong buttons can be touched. For example, when trying to hit the 'back' button, it has disappeared and I've accidentally touched the video call button in one of my apps.
One other frustration I have is with the rolled edge. If I'm holding the phone with one hand and also use the thumb of that hand to touch the screen, the base of my thumb touches the edge and the phone responds as if I intentionally touched that area. Never had that problem with the S7.",att.com
galaxy,5,This is by far the best phone out right now. The 1 star reviews are bogus and I think its user error not phone. Or the Apple fan boys who cant handle I phone you can actually do stuff on other than make calls and text. So if you want boring go with the same old Apply that all look the same or If you want fun and be able to customize everything you want buy the S9,att.com
galaxy,1,"Samsung Health is Missing why??????? It's not compatible, how in the world did that happen???????????????????",att.com
galaxy,5,I love my Galaxy S9 in lilac purple. It's a beautiful phone and performs very well. I'm so happy with my first Galaxy!! I preordered btw.,att.com
galaxy,4,"I have been a Samsung Phone Fan for a long time and this new one is great. It is fast, has plenty of memory and the battery lasts a long time. The only problem that I have is that the keyboard in the vertical position is very small and my man hands are a bit big for it. Wish I got the S9+ which is a bit bigger and may have a better chance of fewer type O's.",att.com
galaxy,5,"I looooove this phone. It has face scan, finger scan and iris scan. I switched from s5 to s9. It has everything I want in a phone. It has fast charging. My son loves ar emogi and slow mo. It is not status symbol but who cares I love the design and specs of s9. Probably iPhone will place the touch id at the back too on their next one",att.com
galaxy,5,Upgraded from S8+ to S9+. EVERY one of the few issues the S8 had have been resolved! Fingerprint scanner is now in a logical location; facial recognition added to iris scan to make unlocking your device much easier; and the camera lives up to all the hype! 6GB RAM on the Plus is more than enough to make this phone lightning fast.,att.com
galaxy,5,"Upgraded from S5 mini, which had become slow and memory constrained by the latest apps. This S9 quadrupled my base memory and with a 400GB SD card (I used a 200GB), plenty of room for pictures, movies, etc. New features, but still familiar. Easy to transfer all apps and data from the old phone. The wireless charger is a good add on.",att.com
galaxy,4,It's a lot different then my s6 . But I'm learning,att.com
galaxy,4,I am in love with this phone. Had a lg g6 and it was awesome but I am a die hard Samsung fan. The camera is amazing along with a lot of other features. Definantly a win. If you d have not like the Samsung edge phones that doesn't matter with this one it's hardly noticeable and doesn't interfere with anything you are doing.,att.com
galaxy,3,"It is user friendly, but half the time the keyboard doesn't pop up for me to type. This can be on any site. I have to restart to make it work. Very frustrating. Researching the issue suggest installing another keyboard. So far I haven't found one I like as well. It seemed to get a little better after I updated some apps.",att.com
galaxy,3,Not impressed with this phone,att.com
galaxy,3,"I had my galaxy s8 for about 2 years and upgraded to the s9. It was not worth the money. Hardly any changes from s8 to s9. I should've just waited for the s10 or foldable phone. I'm soooooooo disappointed.
Otherwise it's a great phone. But save yourself some money and go with the s8 or wait a bit longer.",att.com
galaxy,2,"The big bad flagship phone. Only one notification tone for all notifications including text tones. That's right no more personalized text tones for contacts. So it's got a better camera than the s7. Woo hood. I'm going back to my s7. Samsung, fix this crap. even the old flip phones had this feature.",att.com
galaxy,5,"I’ve always had a galaxy and I went from the 8 to the 9. There’s really not too much different, just some small changes. I upgraded to give my son the 8 and loves it. He switched from iPhone so he’s much happier with the galaxy. The price and specials they have for this phone made it even better.",att.com
galaxy,4,"The phone has so many features I don't know where to start. I love all the new addons for the camera. Being able to write on the pics, high resolution, and quality pics. I love being able to reach my apps from the edge in a second. I'm still getting familiar with my new toy. This one is a winner",att.com
galaxy,5,"This is a big mess of S9 awesomeness! Upgraded from the S7. There's not much of a difference with functionality but the speed, oh my the speed, difference is huge. That alone was worth it to me. Also has superb battery life and the camera is like woah. Could only be happier if it were free!",att.com
galaxy,5,I had left the galaxy family for Apple's iphone 8. Hated that decision. I love the galaxy 9 the camera is amazing a most have. No phone can touch it. Display is the next level. The best color and video quality is like looking at my uhd TV. What more can I say but better get one of your own,att.com
galaxy,1,My wife needed a newer phone to replace her Samsung Galaxy S5. Went with the S9 because it should last for 2-3 years or when the 5G LTE makes it obsolete. We only have AT&T because of the better coverage in our area. I wish AT&T offered the Google phone and other lesser known phones.,att.com
galaxy,5,I just upgraded from a Samsung S5 to a Samsung S9. Loving the curved screen and clear display. Syncing my old phone to my new phone to transfer files and photos was challenging but I got it figured out without contacting pro-tech for help. The starter guide was a definite help!,att.com
galaxy,4,"Overall, it's not much different from my S6, IMO. The camera is way better, though. I miss having the home and back keys. I haven't gotten down the way to touch my screen for that, yet. The larger screen is nice, but nothing *that* spectacular. Overall, I'm pleased with my S9.",att.com
galaxy,4,"The S9 case is very, very slick. Within 2 days I dropped mine, and I thought I had a good grip. The curved screen and side bar thing takes a little getting use to. Performance is nice. What is Bixby and why do I want it? Also, pre-installed apps should just go away.",att.com
galaxy,4,S9 is a great phone great camera fast processor the best screen on a phone hands down great build quality ip68 rating for water and dust 3.5 headphone jack with some cool features ok headphones included but if you don't like a heavy skin on android better look else where.,att.com
galaxy,3,"I like the phone but my S5 had a one open button and the S9 doesnt. So you have to fumble for the button to open everything. Also, it seems like when I didnt do anything, apps open and it is a little confusing. Like did I really open that or did it just do it by itself.",att.com
galaxy,5,I love my new Samsung Galaxy S9 phone..It has great features and I am sooo glad I got it...My LG2 phone was not a good one to have...It became frustrating and I had and wanted the new phone...haven't tried all the features but I love the slim look and easy to handle...,att.com

galaxy,5,So far I love it and it's easy to use! I was a little nervous because this phone uses type C chargers but they provide you with an adapter you can place on your older Samsung charger cord and you can also buy them. I previously had a Samsung note 5.,att.com

iphone,5,"I’ve been with Apple since day 1 of 2007 and the X is by far the best phone to date for sure!! No matter what people are saying about the 7 plus being bigger it’s def not,just read the specs that should be enough right there and all the great new features that come with this phone are fantastic if your due for an upgrade get the X you will not be disappointed,don’t be fooled by the bunk reviews the X is by far the best Phone on the market today!!",att.com
iphone,5,"I went to this from a 6 and no matter what, transfer from one phone to another is never seamless. The biggest thing is no more finger prints! So everything you get into with a fingerprint, you need to remember the password to. I locked myself out of 3 of my accounts. That was a pain, and not every app does facial recognition so be prepared to change passwords, which isn’t a bad thing really. Getting used to swiping everything is easy once you know how and which way to swipe. No home button. But it is easy to forget once you get used to swiping. Battery lasts all day. Big plus. Fast. Bigger plus. I am enjoying getting to know the X.",att.com
iphone,5,"Upgraded from a 3.5 year old iPhone 6. The best thing about this phone is that its overall size is barely larger than my old 6 yet the screen is about 95% the size of my wife's 8+. Larger screen, small package. Face ID is nearly instantaneous. I thought it was a gimmick at first but now that I'm used to it, I don't even think about it. Just pick the phone up, swipe up, and I'm in. I have a 7 for work and when I pick it up, I realize how much I love not having to ever fiddle with the home button--for anything, ever with the X. Screen is amazing. Camera is amazing. I will likely be with this thing for another 3.5 years and I'm fine with that.",att.com
iphone,4,I love how fast this version of iPhone is! But the lack of TouchID makes me realize how much I missed that feature. I may have to get a vertical holder for my car in order to be truly handsfree because the FaceID does not read your face when iPhone is in landscape mode.,att.com
iphone,5,"Surfing the internet is really truly fast almost like using mynhome pc. The text to speech is very accurate. I travel theu the US and the screen does not freeze like people wore claiming. Which was why I waited to upgrade and i travel to places that are -25 degrees. The facial recognition makes it easier to open my phone and you can incorporate it into most apps for ease of use. The camera takes awesome pics and its an all around pretty phone. Big screen enough to watch movies but also compact enough to text with one hand. I Love this phone and it takes care of my personal, financial and work needs. Plus large capacity storage for the size.",att.com
iphone,3,"I was SUPER excite about getting this phone. Pre-ordered it and waited anxiously for it to arrive. When it came and I was able to open it, the size surprised me. It was so small compared to my 7+. After having this phone for about 2 weeks now it leaves a lot to be desired. Most apps don't take up the full screen, leaving a back bar of empty, unused space at the top and bottom, which in turn makes the screen smaller then my 7+. The camera isn't thaatt much better than my 7+. Its thicker and heavier. It seems to be that for what it cost you get a device that leaves a lot to desired. It made me start looking at the Note 8.........",att.com
iphone,2,More hype than substance. While the facial recognition system is nice performance is lacking. Phone connection is not clear. Have many complaints that I can not be heard when calling others compared to my old iPhone 7plus. Despite the hype screen size is underwhelming. Improvement on the top & bottom of screen is ineffective when watching video. Width significantly smaller than iPhone 7+ that impacts reading. (See Photo). Best feature is the camera that allows greater control. Multiple consumer reviews state it is the most breakable phone ever. Finally uying experience was dreadful. Miss days when customer service personal instead of dropped internet connections. Plans that promote free upgrades are worthless when new phones work less effectively than ones they replace.,att.com
iphone,5,"When I saw the first ad for the iPhone X I was like I want that phone. Now that I have had it since the release date I love it but at first I was like oh my what have I done.but I’m happy I stayed with the x. People complain apps are not setup to take full advantage of the x , sadly they knew this going in. Yeah it’s not as big as my 7 plus but you know over all it seems to be a way better phone. The call clarity is amazing. The battery life last a full 2 days for me. The screen is breath taking. And people keep saying the phone is fragile I don’t see it I have dropped mine from waist height about 6 times not even a scratch or crack",att.com
iphone,5,"I’ve been a 10 year Samsung user. I fell in love with this iPhone after a few minutes. I actually just upgraded to a note 8 in November but liked this phone so much that I decided to add a line and get this one. I don’t even touch my note now. Although, it takes me about an hour longer to change my iPhone 10 than It ever did to charge my note. Get the fat charging cube and it will shave some time off of having to wait for a full charge. It’s got a few bugs with compatibility issues, like with he Fitbit, and my gotomeeting call in audio, but other than that I love it. The way to close out of apps is awkward, as well so if they could change that it would be perfect.",att.com
iphone,5,"I can't understand the negative reviews. I have owned every I Phone since their inception. The I Phone X is hands down the best to date. Maneuvering the screen is slightly different but you adjust quickly. The home button is actually an improvement in my opinion. Facial recognition took less then 2 minutes to set up. Additionally facial recognition is quicker and more efficient then the old thumb print on the home button.
Battery life, so far, is outstanding. My other I phones I was charging every 12 hours or so based on my usage. My I Phone X is being charged about every 24 hours. A major improvement, although my results may not be typical. Buy it I don't think that you will have any regrets.",att.com
iphone,1,"Within an hour of getting my phone and setting it up I saw it. There's a 8mm semi-circular crack in my ""gorilla glass"" screen. I didn't notice it at first until I took the phone outside to play with the new camera (which has so many lens flares that are another issue entirely). With the screen illuminated, it's barely noticeable. A phone Of this level should have higher quality standards. I went to the AT&T store and they said they couldn't help me, to take it back to Apple. This is unacceptable in a new product.",att.com
iphone,5,"Just picked up my x on release date i was worried that with a home button i would not like it it. I was wrong it makes life easier especially the face recognition which i was skeptical at first. I really like the touch on my 7+ but face reconition is much faster. Overall this is a big improvement over my 7+ which i thought i was not going to switch but i am glad i did. If you want a smaller phone that will fit better in your pocket with a large screen, faster processor, better camera, faster access to menu then you wont go wrong with the X. Thank you Apple great IPhone",att.com
iphone,5,Apple has done it again. 4K 60fps 4K 24fps no one has this not even super expensive dslr’s. Screen is the best in the industry colors are spot on. I love how it fits perfect in my hand. It is the perfect balance of size and screen realestste. It doesn’t feel overly big tlike the 7 plus did. This phone is a straight monster in performance destroying everything in the market. Face ID is spot on and the gestures are super easy to learn people just don’t like change and complain. Is it worth the money? Yes it is the camera alone is worth the price having all of the shooting options right in your pocket. Well done Apple.,att.com
iphone,3,"I have had iPhone since the first model came out, I upgraded from the 7+ to the iPhone X. I have to say I’ve not been blown away, or even remotely impressed. The new “features” seem to be an attempt to make it seem there was some great changes by simply changing the way things were done, but in a more complicated way. And sorry but you could easily bring the home button back and make everyone happy. I like the size of my 7+ in my hand, personally liked the larger phone. I’m just not really seeing the added value in this phone and find it over rated. I’ve seriously been considering swapping it out for the 8+ and holding out to see if Apply might actually put out another WOW phone soon.",att.com
iphone,3,"Most durable glass ever? I laugh! Attached is a pic of my iphone x right out of the box, i cant speak on anything else as i have not even turned it on.",att.com
iphone,1,Responding to comments from my earlier post. The iPhone X is just to smal especially if you are used to having the plus model iPhones like I have had. Why spend the extra money for Face ID and Animojis??? The new iPhone 8 and iPhone X have just topped the charts as the most fragile smartphones out!!! And they are by far the most expensive to repair. In my opinion they aren’t worth the extra money. I’m a true Apple fan but the new iPhones have let me down so I will be keeping my iPhone 7 Plus and jumping ship to the Samsung Note 8. I have faith that Apple will do the right thing and make a plus sized iPhone X next year but until then I won’t hold my breath,att.com
iphone,5,"Phone is all around incredible. Ridiculous 4K recording. Best battery i have had, better than galaxy s8 plus by a ton",att.com
iphone,3,"I love the screen and clarity. But I’m having a hard time letting go of my iPhone 7+. I thought the camera on the X would be as good, if not better than the 7+ and the flashlight is no where near as bright as my previous iPhones. Not having a button is actually a nice change. I Like the simplicity of swiping to open and close apps. The new iOS is an improved change too. The only issue is moving items around in settings. No one should have to google how to as an email account to an iPhone of they already own an iPhone. Nor should you have to open every tab trying to find where that feature has been moved. Overall, I like the X, but I’m still on the fence about keeping my 7+. I’ve got 11 more days before I have to return it. Hopefully the good will outweigh the bad.",att.com
iphone,4,The phone has a smaller size than other phones with the same size screen. The faceid is what sold me to switch back to an Iphone. It is a game changer for me. I hated to type in a code to unlock the phone everytime I used it. Not having an earphone jack has not been a problem for me. I am disappointed that the phone is much slower to charge than the Samsung S6 I had. The Iphone takes twice as long to charge. I hear the apple is working on a partial solution that will charge at 3/4 as fast as the Samsung. It is not a deal breaker. The new motions to operate the phone have not taken too long to get used to.,att.com
iphone,5,I heard all whistles and bells regarding the IPhone X and was a little bit hesitant of the needs to upgrade from my IPhone 6 plus. Unfortunately I dropped my IPhone 6 plus and now was to make a decision of fixing it or getting a new one so I ordered the new IPhone X. The delivery was fairly fast and by my surprised I was soon to find out that the upgrade was very much noticeable. This phone is the best IPhone ever and do bring a great advantage in the market. this is my experience I do not want to bring technical review but you should do your homework. I chose the 256GB considering that many apps are getting bigger the lower option might not be enough memory by the time I paid your phone off.,att.com
iphone,1,"The phone is larger than all previous iphones, however the screen is more narrow. When I watch landscape video, the screen size expands until it either hits the top and bottom, or the sides, or both (this is normal function), in landscape the video expands until it hits top and bottom and leaves over a 1/2"" of dead screen on each side. this means I am looking at a screen the same size as an old iphone 3 or something. it really really stinks. the narrow screen and resultant small landscape video size is a deal breaker. they can have it back. everyone I show this to is stunned.",att.com
iphone,2,"I switched carriers and the only great deal available was the iPhone BOGO. I have been a loyal Samsung user up until this and switched from the Samsung 8 to the X. I have to be honest, I don’t love it and HATE was the word the first 48 hours. I do like the music options and the camera a lot but other than that I can’t find anything else. Its just difficult to use. The things I could just do before, I have to search for an app now. App after app after app. I hope I will learn to like it but at this point I am counting the hours and minutes until I can get rid of it. If I had any option I would not have this phone.",att.com
iphone,5,The iPhone X is a huge step up from my iPhone 7 Plus and I didn’t expect that. I thought it would just be a nicer screen. But the processor is so much faster. Everything opens and loads instantly. The camera is stunning and the display is the equivalent of my 4K Samsung tv. I was a bit worried with the facial recognition but it works flawlessly. It won’t unlock until you make eye contact and if the phone is ringing it’ll turn down the volume when you look at the phone. Summary? So many fun little features and an amazing processor that never fails. Good Job Apple,att.com
iphone,5,"Upgraded from a 6s. Love the face recognition. Using the phone is different without a home button, but easy to get used to. I had to google a few things like how to shut it down, screen shots, and how to close apps.
The face recognition with Apple Pay is very cool. Face recognition doesn’t work unless your eyes are open and you are looking at the phone. So it feels more private than with the fingerprint scanner.
I chose the silver phone because it looked awesome. But the front and rear of the phone are glass. And it is super slippery. So I looked for a clear silicone case to show off the phone but also keep it safe.
Overall very happy with the new iPhone.",att.com
iphone,5,"Having had every iphone since the first, ands few Galaxy phones as well) I can honestly say that the iPhone X delivered on all fronts. The screen is exceptional to look at. The keyboard seems a little small coming from the 7 Plus. The notch is a non issue during use. Many apps have not optimized for the use of the entire screen and screen dimensions. I think in short term the little quirks will all be worked out quickly by the app developers and Apple. I am very satisfied with the speed of the phone. And the video and picture quality is top notch.",att.com
iphone,5,I was really hesitate on getting the IPhone X because I’m use to the bigger size like the Plus but since I have had the phone I have adjusted and I am loving it. The pictures are soooo clear and amazing I’m glad I went with this phone!!!,att.com
iphone,5,"I truly love the X. I have had many iPhones, and I upgraded from the 7 plus. This is better than any of them. I love the beautiful screen and the face id. It works as well as one would expect from Apple. The design of the phone is gorgeous and the size is perfect. I love the color choices as well. The camera takes fantastic photos and portraits. I’m an Apple groupie I suppose, because I can’t say anything bad about Apple products. The iPhone X is no exception. I’ve loved all my iPhones, and this is my favorite. Thanks, Apple, for such quality products!",att.com
iphone,4,"First: the buying process was painful - waited for nearly an hour for anyone to sell me the product. Then, all they tried to do was upsell, trying to talk me into things I didn't want - terrible.
As for the iPhone X, I like that the screen covers nearly the entire front of the phone. The cameras are great, and there are some other nice features.
On the downside, I would prefer a little smaller overall size - more like the iPhone 7 or 8. Also, the phone gets hot when making a call or other use for more than just a couple minutes.
Definitely overpriced but, I still bought 2 just because I wanted the latest model.",att.com
iphone,3,"I am no average reviewer; I worked as my companies phone manager for over 2 years so I have used every Samsung from S4 up to every iPhone ever made.
Pro’s - Great Display. - Size is perfect. The standard iPhone is too small but the plus is too big. - getting adjusted to no button was easy. - Battery lasts longer. - Animoji’s are cool and I know we will have some cool AR apps that yse this tech.
Con’s - Price is too steep - Fragile phone. Now I haven’t dropped mine but I did see the test on durability and this phone failed. - Lots of apps don’t use the full screen. - The keyboard is still too small. - Auto correct has a glitch in it, and cannot be used. - Animoji’s freeze or don’t work at times. - sound switching is still an issue - Facial recognition doesn’t work all the time. - Siri still isn’t very smart. I asked her what my email address is and she told me she ran into a problem. - Copy and paste still isn’t better than the Galaxy. - Finally price. This phone has an inflated price point.",att.com
iphone,5,"Had a 6 was forced to upgrade to the 7..... the change was.... meh.... the iPhone X is a different animal, heavier... much better looking and with a stunning display that exceeds the size of the 8+.... camera quality is amazing compared to the 7.... people complain about a high price tag when a flagship Samsung is very close .... ;) Apple all the way, quality, finesse and style.... also a phone that will last me 5 years",att.com
iphone,5,"Short and sweet, this is absolutely the best of the best. I love Face ID, the OLED display, 256 Gb, memory, the camera, Animojis,
the size and everything you’ll read in every other 5 star review. IPhone X is a gorgeous phone, it does everything it’s supposed to and fixes are coming super fast for anything it’s not supposed to do which has only been one thing that I can think of. Yes it’s worth the $3.00 more than I paid for iPhone 7 Plus...I have ATT Next and that’s all it comes out to. It’s an awesome phone and I really love it!",att.com
iphone,2,"First off I’ll be an Apple Head forever but the X was for a lack of better terms, a disappointment. I come from the iPhone plus family. And after being used to those phones the size of X was shocking. It’s too hard to get used to a smaller phone after we’ve been accustomed to the size of the plus variety. I recently gave my X back in exchange for the 8 plus. The only difference is the face recognition and the Animoji features. When the X plus comes out I’ll b first in line but for now the 8 plus suits me just fine.",att.com
iphone,3,"As I stated in my first review, the screen is too small on the X, about the size of the iPhone 7. I know the specs say 5.8"", but there is an upper and lower part of the screen that acts like a bezel and is not used. I had to set the AT&T sales people straight and show them the 8 plus has a bigger screen! The keyboard is quite larger on the 8 plus, as it is wider!",att.com
iphone,5,"I am one of those folks upgrading from a plus device (6S plus), so the smaller form factor took some getting used to. The phone is definely narrower but the screen is big and beautiful and to me the size of the phone is perfect. I was mainly concerned that face ID wouldn’t work as well as the finger print reader. It works great! (Makeup, no makeup, glasses on, glasses off, hair up, hair down). It recognizes me and can tell the difference between my daughter and me (we look a lot alike) easily! The phone itself is gorgeous, it’s a shame to cover it up with a case. But it is glass, and I watched all those dropping videos showing how bad they shatter when dropped, so I will definitely use a case. The OLED display is amazing. Colors are definely truer, and black is really really black. I thought the notch would bug me, but it doesn’t. Overall very very happy with the phone and feel lucky to have received it on launch day!",att.com
iphone,5,I love it there is a little learning curve but I love it. It’s a little smaller so it fits in my pocket better without hanging out. The screen size is a tad bigger than the plus without being bigger. The face recognition is wonderful. The colors are much brighter and the speakers are better with more volume. The camera has more features than before. They did a great job with this phone. The only bad thing that I heard about is make sure you have a good case on it cause it doesn’t do well if dropped.,att.com
iphone,4,Love the phone and it’s upgrades however it is so fragile and difficult to find a minimalist drip proof cover to cover all of the front screen including over the raised glass (fragile) to meet where the screen saver ends. I don’t know why Apple chose to design it this way. Also as it is made of glass on front and back I would think more of the aforementioned cases would be available but they are not. I used to love Tech 21 but they don’t fit bc of the front screen design. Also it is so small I have difficulty locating it esp in my purse after using my Uphone 6SPlus and I wish they offered it in the Rose Gold color.,att.com
iphone,5,"While I was ready for an updated iPhone since my 6+ the reviews made me hesitate. All poppy cock! You will not miss the home button or the frame surrounding the screen. In fact, not only do you gain more screen real estate than a plus the iPhone X is narrower and fits easier in the palm of your hand! Furthermore, the face recognition feature is faster and more natural to navigate than the home button. I adjusted to the change in less than a minute. Sexy to hold, navigate and see with a camera/photos that will blow you away. Joy to the world. Thank-you Apple!!! LOVE!",att.com
iphone,5,"I am so in love with this phone! The camera is amazing! If you use the portrait mode under the actual camera app it takes the most amazing pictures! The face recognition is awesome especially to able to use it to sign in to everything on my phone including banking. Another cool feature is that I have ATT home internet which came with an extremely long pointless WiFi password, my friend went to log in to my WiFi the other day and it alerted me on my phone and asked me if I wanted to approve her, then it connected her right away after I hit accept! Such a time saver! Love it and completely worth the money!",att.com
iphone,2,"I came from the 7 plus, the OLED screen and aniemoji interested me highly. Once I got the X, it was a learning curve getting used to no home button and I loved how smooth IOS devices are but this phone I’ve had for about 4 months and I hate how I’m multitasking that it has to reload tasks constantly due to the 3GB of ram. The worse part is when the phone decides to randomly restart every once and a while, the back glass scratches super easy with light use and battery life is ok. I hate the face unlock because I’m the morning it doesn’t recognize you when your on your side laying down and definitely miss the fingerprint reader. I don’t think it was worth the upgrade or 1k price tag so to speak, and I’d say stick with an 7-8 generation of iPhone.",att.com
iphone,5,"I was hesitant on purchasing the new iPhone X, I thought the lack of a home button and the new Face ID would be a disappointment. Days before receiving it in the mail I wanted to cancel My order because I was convinced I would not like it. Every time I used someone else’s x I had trouble understanding its functionality. One day after transferring over the the x I couldn’t be happier. It really is the most amazing phone. Everyone that had one was trying to explain to me how amazing it is but the point is you can’t explain it. You just have to use it. It becomes an extension of you.",att.com
iphone,2,"Having upgraded to every iPhone made since 2002, I was massively disappointed by my experience with the iPhone X. It feels extremely uncomfortable in my hands, and the face rec is literally awful. The battery life is not any better than recent phones, the screen is fine but not a huge step forward, and I can’t reach the entire screen without moving my hands. I’ll be moving back to my iPhone 6s for the time being, and considering my next move. Can’t believe I have to consider another manuf...",att.com
iphone,1,"Used the phone for 2 days after upgrading from the iPhone 6. Unlike the 6, the X gets covered in dozens of micro scratches just being in your pocket without a screen protector on it. The height difference makes this heavier, thicker, top heavy, and more prone to falling out of your hand. Not to mention this is a slippery device to hold without a case and the stainless steel boarder. Most cases for this phone are thicker and wider for more protection since the phone has two large pieces of glass and it’s substatially heavier which means dropping it is going to chip the stainless steel or crack the front and/or the back of the screen. I’m currently using a Spigen case and has improved the grip of the phone. No am/pm for the time next to the notch. No battery percentage next to the notch. No customization options for the notch. On the technical standpoint I’ve had issues with making calls and sharing photos. For the two days that I’ve had the phone. More issues than having the iPhone 6 for two years. I’ve had to restart the phone because of this at least 6 times so far. I wouldn’t expect ATT to send defective phones and have never heard of anyone having to send back defective phones but I feel as though this will be the phone a lot of people return.",att.com
iphone,5,"I was a bit skeptical at first on upgrading to the X for both the cost and some of the new features such as face id. Bought it online though since they advertise free online returns and no restocking fee, figure I'd take a chance and give it a try for a few days. Initial impression was amazing screen and all the features I was skeptical about weren't really a big deal. I was shocked that most of my apps already had FaceID built into them, this was honestly my biggest worry of not having a fingerprint scanner anymore.
Having no home button has taken the longest to get used to but that is a really minor thing and is more so just needing to retrain my muscle memory. Would highly recommend making the jump to this iphone especially if buying online and can return for free.",att.com
iphone,4,I like everything apple and I like this phone. the only reason this isn’t a five start is many because of the fact I like to close apps and it is a pain to do now. I like the facial recognition and not having a home button and some of the new shortcuts they have put in. It is also nice that now it keeps you signed out of everything until it does the facial recognition or password. Same with text and any messages it won’t appear until it does the recognition. So overall it work smooth and I’m starting to get use to how different it is from all of the previous iPhones I’ve had.,att.com
iphone,1,"I hate my new phone. There was no need to remodel everything. The only thing I like is the speed as you slowed everything else down for the older phones. This phone is horrible and very difficult to use. It’s not even the same phone at all. It’s not user friendly and it’s very difficult to do anything. Everything now takes multiple actions to open and close, no just hitting a button to lock your phone and we can’t figure out how to turn it off or close apps. Its a very expensive unusable piece of technology.",att.com
iphone,1,"The iPhone X is really a piece of garbage that is filled with ridiculous and non-intuitive maneuvers. It constantly freezes-up and presents a very frustrating user experience, especially if you are somewhat of an expert using smartphone apps. DO NOT GET SUCKED INTO BUYING THIS!",att.com
iphone,5,"It took me a while to decide if I wanted the IphoneX or the 8plus. A friend of mind explained it this way.. If you like shiny new things and do not mind paying the price for the X then go with that if you want the same phone as your 7 but newer and a bit more updated then go with the 8 plus. Well I like shiny new things and the newest techy things available so I went with the X. I love the camera, the clear crisp pictures it takes. The face recognition is very cool there are other features that I am expressed with as well oh the battery life I find last longer than the Iphone 7 I had. Overall I am very happy so far.",att.com
iphone,1,Phone has a lot of glitches still. AT&T states it’s due to the new operating system. Regret is definitely kicking in...,att.com
iphone,1,This phone looks like every other iPhone out there. No SUBSTANTIAL or EXCEPTIONAL design. Most people cover up any design with a case or cover anyway. The facial recognition works most of the time but not always. The lack of the home button drives me crazy with all the EXTRA swipes now needed. I just don’t she why people love iPhones in general. This will be my last iPhone. It’s time for a phone with real NEW DESIGN and new functionality that doesn’t slow you down like this iPhone X does. Everyone in my family agrees with me on this. We all go back to our 7plus phones if we could.,att.com
iphone,2,"Don’t get me wrong the phone is beautiful but that’s the only good part about it, after a month of use my screen would no longer turn on, had to drive over 3 hours to an apple store just to get it replaced because AT&T doesn’t replace iPhones, got my replacement now another month later my charging port doesn’t work properly and my screen keeps on freezing. This is absolutely ridiculous I wish I never even bought the phone it’s nothing but a headache please be aware",att.com
iphone,5,This Apple iPhone X is my personal and life coaching business phone. I have enjoyed all my iPhones and this one was another excellent choice! The camera is a pure pleasure to use to produce high quality photos and videos. I also take a lot of photos of nature and am amazed at the quality photos I am rewarded with! I love the size of the screen. It’s size is perfect for my hands to hold and operate without tiring. It moves between apps quickly and easily. I’m learning all the amazing secrets of this phone and having a blast!!,att.com
iphone,1,"I have been trying the iPhone X for several days, upgrading from my iPhone 6 Plus. While it has some cute features, there is not enough to justify the price tag. I'm not sure there is enough to justify a lower price tag. The screen is smaller than my previous phone and requires two hands to use most of the time. I am returning the phone to try and find one with the simplicity I enjoyed.",att.com
iphone,2,"This phone is way overrated not to mention costly ! The face recognition is a unique feature however it doesn’t work in the dark , with glasses or sunglasses on , I find myself manually inputting the numeral code to often to unlock the phone , liked the finger print option better . Don’t see much difference in the picture quality than my I phone 6 S or the battery lasting longer . It has 64 GB of memory which was better than 16 GB on 6 S but I think all phones come with that feature now . No buttons to hold to Access Siri is about the only good feature of this but I don’t use Siri enough offset the other items . Last but not least it is more difficult to get out of programs , you have to swipe up , hold then hold the program until a red minus sign pops up then you can get out . I think I paid a whole lot more for there advertising gimmick of some of the features . Would take my I phone 6s any day over this phone .",att.com
iphone,4,"I have been using iphone for about 8 years. This is the best phone ever. I have used samsung galaxy for three times and i switched back to iphone no matter what. The last iphone i had was iphone 8plus. I loved it because of the big screen and fast and stylish. Those plus sizes are so big in my hand. I wanted to try iphone x and got the iphone x. I instantly love it, its small yet its big screen. The weight is light and its easy to hold the phone. However, there is one problem. It freezes!! Sometimes, i called a person and i couldnt hear. I had to turn on speaker to talk. I had to restart the phone to get normal. Sometimes im on web page, its stuck in there. This is the only issue i have. Other than that, this is thr best iphone in iphone generation.",att.com
iphone,1,"Love: - screen almost as big as iPhone8+, but the phone is a bit bigger than iPhone8 - FaceID works really well, and very easy+fast to setup -- much much better than TouchID when it first came out
Hate: With the removal of the Home button, there goes every feature that relied on it. Instead Apple designed new, quirky, cumbersome (to say the least) ways to do the same, except with Horribly Painful user experience. To name a few: - to terminate a running app: * before: double click on Home button, slide app Up to close it - finish in 1 sec * iPhoneX: slide from bottom extremely and carefully and precisely (if not, you get something else!!!) until you get what you want, THEN, press-hold the app for at least 1sec until a f*cking Delete button appears, THEN, touch the Delete button - to see All running apps: this is a similar ordeal. - to use Touch: NONE. This feature NO LONGER exists - to use FaceID to allow App purchase (or other things) * before: just press-hold touch for about 1sec * iPhoneX: must press Power button twice, and REALLY QUICKLY!!! (to avoid turning of screen) - since the button is on the side, this becomes extremely hard to do with just one hand!
Overall: I'd rather get iPhone7/8/9 Plus. With the iPhoneX, I think they walked 5 steps forward only to go 10 steps sideways - ie, all-in-all, they've made almost 0 (or Backward!) progress in making the X ""better"".
If you can leave with the serious limitations and loves past iPhones, then this is for YOU. If you loved iPhone before, stay with the 7/8/9/etc. If you never used iPhone, Do NOT get the X.",att.com
iphone,5,"This IS the most beautiful, fluid, high-quality smart phone I’ve ever owned. There are a few new things to learn if you’re a previous iPhone user, but within a day or two, it was almost second nature. I picked up my wife’s iPhone 8, and without thinking, started using iPhone X gestures. Some ppl have complained about losing the home button or finger print ID, I don’t miss them. You don’t loose more than a second from the previous version to see opened apps and close them- which was one gripe I read. If you are part of the Apple ecosystem and are ready for the next gen tech type instead of the same old stuff— this is it!",att.com
iphone,1,I was really EXCITED about the X until the day i actually received it and called it my VERY own. However I’m not at all excited as I was when it launched. Coming from a 7 Plus to the X is a highly dissatisfaction to me. I just can’t seem to adjust to this SMALLER version phone. I’m trying my best to stick with it but it is so hard. My fingers seem to cramp holding on to this phone. The screen definitely doesn’t seem to be a 5.8 screen that’s for sure. I’m definitely considering returning the X for and 8 plus until they consider a X PLUS!! If the X body was the fit of the Plus I would highly recommend it but if your coming from a PLUS to the x you better highly think “TWICE” before your purchase because it’s definitely a hard adjustment.,att.com
iphone,5,"I had the 8Plus and even though they technically have the same internal workings, it’s certainly not the same phone. It’s truly something new for Apple. I’m in love with this phone and couldn’t say any more good things about it.",att.com
iphone,1,The phone has so many issues. It freezes. The touch sensor goes out so when that happens there’s no access into your phone. ATT has been zero help. This occurred 2 days after I purchased my phone and they will not fix it or exchange it. It lags. There’s just better quality phones than this one.,att.com
iphone,2,"My iPhone X screen becomes unresponsive immediately when I walk outside into cold weather, good luck typing or navigating phone. Phone advertises as being a larger display, but the aspect ratio is way off.. videos look very small and cropped, and when using zoom to watch videos full screen it cuts off a lot of the picture.. other than those two issues the phone is amazing. Those are pretty big issues though especially for the high price tag.",att.com
iphone,5,"If you are an avid iPhone user you will love this phone! I takes about a day or so to get use to the new gestures and the absence of a home button, but once you become familiar with the new setup...its off to the races. Even though this phone is smaller than the plus models, the screen is much bigger and I love it. The capability of the phone (especially the 256 gig) is outstanding. I won't even attempt to describe its entertainment value, as my words couldn't come close to doing it justice. All I can say is, just upgrade to this phone and you won't be disappointed.",att.com
iphone,3,"I bought the X back in December and ended up returning it a week later. While the design is nice, there wasn't anything amazing that it did over my 7 Plus. It just felt like another iPhone. Nothing new. I don't really need the animoji feature. The edge to edge screen was nice, but in reality when viewing media, it displayed the videos in a smaller viewing than the 7 Plus. It was average, for me. I'll see what Apple has in store for the fall.",att.com
iphone,5,Just got my X this is the greatest phone ever have had new iPhones since 2007 finally they gave us what we wanted,att.com
iphone,3,"I am not that please with this phone. It doesn't keep the settings as designated. When I take a photo and try to send it via text or email, it gets hung up in the ""To"" field. This has happened at least a dozen times and I've had my phone for 5 lousy days. I then have to reset the phone everytime. When I had my i-Phone 6, it would automatically connect to my wi-fi and come....on the phone, I have go into settings and log in every time.",att.com
iphone,3,I'm really disappointed on how small this phone is considering that I've been so use to my 7 plus! They really fooled a lot of us with that but other than that it's okay I like the Face ID and camera/features are better! Hopefully next year we get a Iphone X plus lol,att.com
iphone,1,"I sincerely dislike this phone. Easy to navigate after a day or so. Biggest deciding factor was that it's difficult getting used to screen size going from 6plus. I understand X is ""bigger"" measuring diagonally, however I rather the wider (plus devices) for easier viewing/reading. Also, facial recognition sometimes works & sometimes doesn't. On speaker phone speaker sometimes will sound strained if loud sound comes thru call. Lots of missed calls even after making sure sleep mode is off...I think it's something to do w speaker. With brightness turned all the way up there appears to be overcast on screen in sun. Phone was really just not a good fit for me personally. Was expecting way more with this price tag. Transfering this phone to a family member ASAP. Just not worth the hype.",att.com

iphone,1,I was talked out of the iPhone 8 Plus for the I phone X don’t do it. The face view barely works and the missing home button is frustrating. The phone freezes never had these issues with the other I phones.,att.com
iphone,5,Ever since Apple released a plus version of their phones I’ve owned one and never saw myself going back to the reg size or version. But honestly I have to daub i love this phone it is flawless at least for me no issues yet! iOS is real smooth and snappy. Although iPhone XS Max has been released its an S versión sob i am not in no rush to get the plus with really minor upgrades mostly in the camera area if you really compare them. I’ll see and wait for the next big thing. But anyone thinking of getting this phone coming from an older gen I really recommend it.,att.com
iphone,1,"Maybe I got a lemon, but the phone is completely unusable after less than a week of ownership. Screens switch back and forth at will and apps randomly open and close. I've read it could be from the screen being put on incorrectly at the manufacturer. For this much money, it should work!",att.com
iphone,5,"I absolutely love this phone !! I wasn’t planning on getting it but when I saw it in person and played with it my jaw dropped . Absolutely amazing !! Super easy to use . I thought I wouldn’t get used to not having the home button , the thought scared me but it’s super simple to go back home. The screen is huge! The battery life is super long . Super clear videos , and the pictures WOW Amazing!!!! I love it !!! Best purchase ive made!!",att.com
iphone,1,"I was really excited when I ordered this phone but such a disappointment. its really glitchy, freezes all the time, disconnects calls all the time amongst a lot of other things. been on the phone with customer service a few times with a few trips to the Store. I dont know what else to get since I've been an advocate for these products for the longest time and sadly this is the first time I just can't. going again to the Store this Sunday so this is getting very annoying.",att.com
iphone,1,I HATE this phone!!! The face recognition sucks needs to have finger print as a back up especially since you can only have one face. When I delete emails they come back into my inbox like 2 seconds later. The buttons are directly across from each other so I’m continually screenshoting things. They have added multiple steps to do virtually everything. This phone is NOT user friendly at all! Oh and did I mention how slooowwww it is! I want my 7plus back!,att.com
iphone,1,"At first the phone was great , great quality photos as always. But the phone gmstatyrd glitching a month after I purchase. It always glitches and it gets worse as the phone gets warm from either the sun or from under a pillow. I’m down grading to the iPhone 8.",att.com
iphone,5,"First of all.. This phone is absolutely stunning to look at. The craftsmanship and attention to detail and materials used are just perfection. Secondly, I thought I would miss the home button (have had Iphones for several years). I forgot all about the home button within 5 minutes of using this device. The gestures and swipes used in place of the home button are natural and intuitive and not at all hard to learn. In fact, I think it is much faster on this phone without the home button. Thirdly, face ID is flawless. Works every time, morning or night. Fourthly, the oled display is gorgeous. I could go on and on but I won’t. Simply put... buy this phone if you want THE BEST!",att.com
iphone,2,I'm a woman with long hair... sometimes I wear it up and other times it's down. So there were times when it didn't recognize me. So I'd have to move my hair and head all around for it to open the phone and would end up having to put in my code half the time. So much for that! So when I returned it for an 8 they told me they never heard of anyone else having the issue and charged me a restocking fee! I could have gotten another X but why relive that annoyance twice?,att.com
iphone,1,This is definitely not the best iPhone released phone is very glitchy and buggy and could be a lot better. There is no way to really do anything if it freezes because there is no more home button,att.com
iphone,5,"I checked reviews before I purchased this phone, and almost hesitated and bought an 8 instead after reading complaints about new swiping functions and the removal of the home button. After a little over a week of use, I can’t think of anything negative to say about it. The changes are very easy to adapt to and user-friendly, and definitely a huge upgrade from my 6s. The camera and sound are amazing, and I haven’t encountered any problems or glitches. On top of how easy and fun the phone is to use, it also looks great! There is still more to experiment with, but so far I am very happy with it.",att.com

Sometimes I pick up my phone and I’m locked out for 5 minutes. Cleaning they screen, resetting the phone to factory settings and buying a case have barely helped. Regretting the purchase.",att.com
iphone,2,"If you like the size of the plus phones then the X is too small; it doesnt matter that the screen is “bigger”. Every task requires so many extra steps (closing apps, looking for icons such as Do Not Disturb). Face ID is super inaccurate. Overall, it is an expensive phone and not worth it. I will most likely exchange for the 8plus.",att.com
iphone,1,Not real impressed. Camera isn’t that great and apps keep locking up.,att.com
iphone,3,"I was really excited to get this phone on pre-order until I actually received. After a few weeks with it I decided to return it. The ""full"" screen is obviously not full screen and that notch at the top will drive you nuts. Face ID doesn't work quickly and about 80% of the time you'll end up typing in your pass code anyways.
When making calls I was told that it was extremely difficult to hear me and like I was underwater. You have to hold the phone right in front of your mouth for people to be able to hear you. If you hold the phone 1-2+ inches away it will be extremely difficult for others to hear you.
I was moving from my iPhone 6s and really miss having a headphone jack. It's the times when you get to the gym or are at work and want to listen something and don't have the dongle or Apple supplied headphones.
On top of the design flaws of this phone it was also really glitchy. My apps and folders opened a lot slower than they did on my 6s. I wasn't able to make calls one day until I restarted the phone. Sometimes the flashlight wouldn't work at all, no matter how many times you tapped it.
The one pro that I will mention was the battery life, which was the main reason for my switch from my old 6s. The battery lasted all day while using multiple apps.
When I paid the hefty price for the phone I was a little weary because that's a lot for a phone, but I was fine with it. A phone is an investment in your everyday life. But when I received this purchase I expected to be amazed and definitely was not. Overall, I would not purchase this phone again and after years of buying countless Apple products-Apple Watch, Apple TV, Macbook Air, iMac, iPad Pro, iPhone..... I'm sad to say that I'll be giving Android a good look for my next phone.",att.com
iphone,4,I love the new fave recognition but have found many times I have to lift my phone up and literally stare at it to get it to open. I feel like people are wondering what I am doing! I do the love it for savings passwords and then opening them up! I also strongly dislike the sos feature! It is where you hold down both buttons in both sides of the phone and it calls 911. Terrible feature as I have accidentally done it three times since I had it (2weeka ago)! Not sure if That’s a feature hat be turned off but I will if I can! Still getting used to the no home button too but it’d not do bad!,att.com
iphone,3,"I like the smaller size than the plus, and no home button is good. But other than that the phone is just ok.
- turned “True Tone” off. Display looks too yellow otherwise. With it turned off, it looks too “cool blue.”
- do not like Face ID. Wish there was a fingerprint sensor instead. Ended up just turning it off which makes my phone less secure because I don’t want to enter a password either.
- why is the power button so big? I end up taking a screenshot or sleeping the screen every time I turn the volume up or down. Why place these buttons directly opposite each other?
These are kind of big things that annoy me when it comes to a phone because they are huge parts of using a phone.",att.com
iphone,1,Over the past two weeks -the new AT&T iPhone X has worked fine - unless you need a GPS map display and it's hot outside. Three times in past week screen goes dim when running Maps or Google Maps for GPS directions. Screen dims to point where you cannot see map at all.,att.com
iphone,4,I wish for the large unreasonable price it came as a PLUS. Needs to be thicker and it is very slippery. The button is close to the up and down volume that when you grab it your hand touches both side and then you can't turn it off and instead adjust the volume. Not made for large finger. I am getting used to it. The facial pass is great and colors and graphics are great. It runs fast. A little slow on downloading apps and moving email around. I miss being able to listen to music at work because I can not charge it at the same time. Ask me for more in a few months. LOL,att.com
iphone,5,"I made the jump from a 7plus, and haven’t looked back. It took me about a day to get used to the new gestures that are used in place of the home button, and now, when I use my wife’s iPhone 7, it feels totally unnatural. I’m impressed with the battery life, the screen, the camera, pretty much everything. To me, the only downside is the price... Apple should have found a way to make it cost a couple hundred dollars less. Editing to remove specific mention of the price, because apparently not everyone knows how much the iPhone costs, and its against AT&T policy for me to mention it here.",att.com

iphone,3,"So to start with, don’t get me wrong, it’s a beautiful phone. However, for the price point, it was way overpriced. If you have an iPhone 7 or 7+ then truly the upgrade is not worth it

iphone,2,I thought the X was going so be a significant upgrade from my 7Plus. I was told over by the customer service/sales dept that the the X was the same size as the 7plus and that it had much better features. They also told me that all iPhones are moving towards getting rid of the home button and that getting the x would get me used to navigating without it. I can’t stand this phone... it’s significantlh smaller and as far as the upgrades from the 7s... I really can’t tell any difference and the no home button is annoying! I’m hoping I can still exchange,att.com

I am seriously considering not getting another & sticking with my 7 plus.,att.com
iphone,5,"I switched carriers so I decided to upgrade and went with the X. I was a little worried that I would miss my finger print, but so far I am very happy with the Face ID.

Learning the new gestures did take a few days to get use to and even after three weeks I’m still getting use gesturing. I love the size it’s not too small and not to big like the plus. Overall it is a very nice phone and worth the money. I came from iPhone 7 and 8 plus and I’m very happy I took a chance on the X.",att.com

iphone,3,I love the iPhone X other than it’s size. I am a diabetic and can not see very well. The IPhone 7 Plus with large bold text was perfect for me. I can barely see to use my X even with glasses. Unfortunately this is a disappointment to me because there isn’t a PLUS option for those with difficulty seeing well like myself.,att.com
iphone,2,"The phone itself works great! It is just what any iPhone user would expect. HOWEVER, it is so fragile! I always use a screen protector and I throroughly research good cases for my phones. Still, the glass on the back of the phone broke almost immediately, and the cost to repair it without Apple care is ridiculous. I don’t know who had the idea to put the glass on the back of an iPhone, but firstly, it was a bad idea, and secondly, they should have warned us about the fragility.",att.com

The iPhone X is a beautifully design phone. The battery/processor/camera stand out. I was skeptic about the Face ID, but I love the fact I can just log in to anything with just my face.",att.com
iphone,4,"Bottom line first- I like the iPhone X, I don't love it. My primary negative comment is the screen is not as large as my 6s Plus, no way! The X screen is SLIGHTLY longer but THINNER. The screen configuration results in the keyboard and characters being much smaller requiring anyone with normal sized fingers to turn the phone sideways to type. Most of the screen is not used by webpages and most apps and as a result you still have the border top and bottom. Apple says vendors will adapt, who knows? Face recognition, Apple Pay etc. work great and the processor is the fastest yet. Battery life is not spectacular either. The new gestures take a while to perfect but it is not a big deal to learn. I still prefer the home button to the constant need to swipe up on the new X. Phone is pricey so think twice as bang for the buck may be slightly lacking. All in all, my 6s plus is just as good, just not as fast.",att.com

iphone,5,"The iphone x is unique in its own way. It is a step away from the ""classic"" layout, look and feel for iphones. I've heard a mix of good and bad things about this phone specifically. The features on this phone are all what they are made out to be. The face ID is absolutely mind blowing and it one of the easiest things to use. This phone is compatible for wireless charging which is so nice for us lazy people. It is bigger than the iphone 8, yet smaller than the plus. It has portrait mode on both front and back cameras, which makes the picture quality amazing. I really thought that not having a home button would bother me, but since i've had this phone for a while now i don't think i could ever go back to a home button.",att.com
iphone,5,"The X truly has the “x” factor. It is seemlessly comfortable to use. Smooth and fluid to the touch and each gesture reflects similar haptic responses. I would say this is the best iPhone I have ever owned. Having last the 7 plus I was worried that the size would be a negative impact, it is not. the screen is larger and yet so much easier to hold and interact with. The length of the screen is great when reading articles and beyond texting I seldom have to use two hands. The experience transports you back to age ten atop your bike ripping down the tallest hill in the neighborhood, well you get The drift. It’s easy, fun, and reminds you that things will always get better, but most importantly enjoy the experience “now!”",att.com

iphone,5,"This is a beautiful phone. It’s not really an issue that there is no home button or headphone jack, as swiping up from the bottom works perfectly to take you home, and Apple includes earbuds that plug into the lightning charger port in case you don’t have wireless headphones. The glass back, front screen with curved sides, and bigger picture all make this a beautiful object, though because it is so incredibly expensive, you will probably want to put it in a case and put on a screen protector, which will compromise its beauty. The camera also takes gorgeous photos.",att.com

iphone,5,"Not having a home button takes a little getting used to, but after just a few hours, it felt comfortable. We bought an Iphone 8 at the same time and getting it set up using the home button felt awkward and clunky compared to the X. Also, facial recognition is much more of a big deal than I thought it would be. Just having to look at the camera rather than use a fingerprint is much more convenient. Concerns that I had read about problems with the recognition working at angles or in total darkness turned out to be non-issues. Battery life could be better - a lot better, really - but I'm able to get a full day of heavy use out of it, so it hasn't been that big of an issues for me.

Facial ID is the bomb while screen size is (in my opinion) optimal though smaller than the iPhone 8. I say optimal because at some point in the evolution of smart phones as the screens get progressively larger the device ceases to be a phone and becomes a tablet or mini-laptop. If you want a phone buy an iPhone X. If you want a tablet (or larger) then buy that type device and “enjoy” lugging that around. As for me, the iPhone X is easy to see with unmatched clarity, and is easy to carry on your belt or in your pocket (or anywhere else you desire) without toting some sort of “brick” around with you.",att.com
iphone,5,I upgraded from the 6+. I was always running out of storage so I was super excited to see that this phone came with more storage and I don’t have to purchase additional storage from Apple. The phone size is great. It’s not as big as the 6+ and fits in my back pocket nicely. The new emoji option is fun. The camera takes amazing photos and I love the selfie option it gives you multiple lighting options and there is an option to make comments on your pictures before you send them. The battery is also great it lasts all day even with excessive phone use.,att.com
iphone,1,Only purchased this phone a week ago and already having problems. My screen went flashing green and is frozen. I can not use it and AT&T will not help me they said it's an Apple problem. Very disappointed!!,att.com
iphone,5,"I have to admit that I went in with a negative attitude for the iphone. I went and got the first iPhone when it came out and I hated it. I was back at ATT within a week to get another android. Fast forward, I was intrigued by the IPhone 6 plus, so I tried it and again I needed my android so it went back. Now the IPhone X comes on scene, I decided to give it a shot. Mainly because my beloved androids lacked internal memory and 256gb sounded awesome. Yes, I am aware you can install an SD Card but they have locked the card so that it cannot be used for apps. My internal memory on my S7 was full and I had over 100gb on my SD Card that I could only use for pics, vids, and music. Way to go Android, expandable memory my butt. Anyway, back to the IPhone X. I was really concerned about losing my customization options like my widgets and my apps. I have had this phone for a few days now and I can honestly say that I am so happy I gave it a shot. I had my ringtones on it in a few minutes, and I have made more. Yes, you do have to use ITunes to do that but it really does only take a few minutes. I only found one of my apps that was not available on iPhone but I got another that does everything that app did. The Camera's on this phone are amazing and I really love the face ID. I transferred all my music over and after I transferred everything from my S7 over I still have over 200gb of internal memory left. I really do love this IPhone, that is something I was not planning on doing. The phone is gorgeous and I hate covering it with a case but I plan on having this phone for a long time. Good job Apple, and Android...get your game on or a lot of other android users will be saying goodbye.",att.com
iphone,5,"I went from an iPhone 7 Plus to the X. I was skeptical because it was smaller, the face recognition was different for me, and no home button. However my mind was changed within the first week of using the X. It’s more streamlined, faster, clearer screen, the audio is killer, and the face recognition is saving time. I went back and forth the first week with whether or not I should change to the 8 Plus and now I’m so glad I didn’t!",att.com
iphone,5,"I was a little hesitant on the idea of no home button, however it is easily something that I got used to not having. Pretty much, I feel like the phone is still very similar to the 7-8 models which are great overall in my opinion anyways. I did go from the 7plus to the xphone and it is very small compared to plus for sure and that takes some adjusting to in handling the phone, etc. It's camera quality is also similar to the 7plus but there are added filters and such with the new xphone. I do not feel like I will be disappointed in my upgrade at all !",att.com
iphone,5,This is the best iPhone yet people complained when the plus sized phones came out and now they complain when it's more hand friendly I think people just like to complain the X has way better features then any Samsung and 8plus the 8 only has a LCD display the X has oled which is WAYYYY BETTER deeper blacks brighter whites and colors plus it has a bigger screen then the 8plus which is amazing,att.com
iphone,1,"I phone x has nice camera in front and back, but the face identification dosenot work perfectly. LG V30 works better. Identifying your voice as command is worst. Unlocking is hard. It is heavy in hand. I did not like. I returned that. I got LG v30. It is very more responsible than iphone X.",att.com
iphone,5,"Overall I enjoy my new phone, I switched from an IPhone 6 so I have a lot of catching up to do. I don't really like that I cannot listen to my headphones and traditionally charge my phone at the same time. I also am not a fan of having to keep up with the head phone adapter so I can use my head phones on my MacBook. I like being able to easily swipe between applications and the larger screen is definitely a perk.",att.com
iphone,5,The phone is smaller than my 7 plus but the screen is larger. So far I love it. YouTube videos can been seen full size you just need to swipe the screen from inside out to widen it to full screen. The X is fast and the facial scan works great so far.,att.com
iphone,1,It’s really not worth the money. I myself miss my iPhone 7. The battery really sucks on the iPhone .,att.com
iphone,5,This phone felt weird at first but it felt better after every hour of owning it. It’s amazing!!!,att.com
iphone,5,"I was initially disappointed because although he screen size is 5.8, it’s narrower than the Plus’ 5.5 screen. I did adjust to the minor loss of width, and actually appreciate how much better the X fits in my hand, and my pockets! The Plus was a monster that didn’t fit anywhere. I bought the X despite it having Face ID and no Touch ID, but I quickly fell in love with Face ID! I especially love that Face ID does not show notification previews until I unlock it with my face; I no longer need to place my phone screen down to prevent other people from seeing my texts.
The screen is stunningly beautiful, especially when watching movies or videos. I hated the notch before I bought the phone and thought I’d end up returning it because it would annoy me that much but my fears were unfounded. I don’t really notice the notch much anymore, primarily because it’s above the reading area.
I could go on and on about this phone but I’ll stop now :) Great job Apple!
P.S. Battery life could be better. I do miss the battery life of the Plus but I wouldn’t go back to it.",att.com
iphone,3,No big deal. Same as others and not worth the big $$$$$,att.com
iphone,4,"The one issue i have... I keep taking screen shots! In order to wake the phone up, you have to press the side button- which is you hit the volume and that together- takes a screen shot! and that, is annoying as all heck. Otherwise, the phone is beautiful. easy, seamless, and the display is truly WOW. also, it continually amuses me that i don't have to freak out if i get it slightly wet. like, my hands are wet form dishes, etc. its really nice to know that you don't have to worry!",att.com
iphone,5,"I’m in love with the iPhone X! The new design is so amazing. I love the phone size, as the plus was getting a little large for my liking. This one is much more manageable for one handed use.",att.com
iphone,1,"It’s hard to use. Specifically, I find difficult: Taking screen shots, turning it off, I don’t like swiping up instead of having a home button, the size -it’s too big to hold in one hand.",att.com
iphone,5,"At first sight, the well known notch design appears to be highly unattractive. However, once the device is in hand, you begin to notice it less often. The fact that one can hold their smartphone in one hand again without sacrificing screen real estate is fantastic! The new iphone X feels and is premium all around! The new OLED display provides a rich and vibrant viewing experience without emitting overly saturated colors, camera technology is out of this world, speed is completely insane, and the battery life is much better than expected! Sure, the iphone X isn't perfect in every way possible but is indeed a step in a new direction; revolutionary. This is by far the best iphone to date and I'm sure it's only going to keep getting better! -Harmonious",att.com
iphone,2,Had my phone less than a week. Frozen home screen while out of town. Tried to reset it and it called 911 and could not hang up. Very upset and frustrated along with a big Disappointment.,att.com
iphone,5,"Just one word, Amazing , great design ,great Screen, loved the new improved OLED screen, Camera captures the intricate details , high resolution pictures and videos . Face ID works smoothly , easier than Touch ID to setup. Animoji is fun. Moving towards the future, this iPhone upgrade is definitely worth it . Apple has always been an innovator. Great Product. Hands Down iOS.",att.com
iphone,5,"I recently pre-ordered the iPhone X 256 GB on October 27th. It shipped on November 7th. I was so excited about the phone that I picked it up from the post office. I took the box to AT&T store and it was activated right out the box.
Let’s get to the point, the phone is very nice, sleek, and sexy. It the Face I.D works just as good as Touch ID if not better. The technology they put into making this device is extremely powerful and accurate. This is the iPhone I’ve been waiting for since 2007.
The camera on this phone is superb and does so many different things. Facial recognition is even tied into your emojis which is nice.
The battery life on this phone actually is very good. It last me the entire day and some with moderate to heavy usage.",att.com
iphone,5,"I have to admit, I was very scared ordering this phone. I went as far as making my husband promise he would give me his 7 plus if I didn’t like the X. I have to say I love this phone. I upgraded from the 6s plus. It is smaller which I actually like because I find it easier to handle. The facial recognition was the scariest part for me. I was afraid I would miss the thumbprint for accessing the phone and most of my apps. Truthfully, I don’t. The facial recognition is much better by far. The apps that I would access using my thumbprint, I now access using the facial recognition. There are many pluses over my previous phone. Much smooth movement throughout the phone. The screen is much sharper. Definitely a great phone that I am recommending to everyone.",att.com
iphone,4,"It was worth waiting in line for two hours to get this phone. I love all the features, it runs smoothly and fast. Although I do wish the screen was a little bit bigger. I’m really into big screens and this screen seems to be not much of a big difference from the iPhone 7+ and iPhone 8+ phones, but other than that the iPhone X has lived up to the hype. I love it!",att.com
iphone,5,I just began getting my credit back together when I came by the store and next thing I know I’ve gotten the Newest IPhone and I’m so thankful to not just have the X but I’m with a reliable company who works with their customers!!! Hence why not only do my children have Apple as well but I’m also the proud owner of the Apple Watch and AirPods.. hopefully soon a Ipad,att.com
iphone,5,This is the best iPhone yet .. I switch from android to get this phone.. I really hope the rumors of apple killing this phone aren’t true.. the build quality and the weight of the phone is perfect .. the edge to edge screen is super beautiful.. att ship my order really fast and had it the next aftertnoon thank you att and Apple I can’t say enough about this phone,att.com
iphone,3,"Apple would have you believe that this is the greatest smartphone ever, with the largest screen of any iPhone. But that's not quite true. Measured diagonally, X has a 5.8"" screen versus the 5.5"" of the 8S. But you have to knock part of that off because the ""horns"" are unusable space in your apps. What you end up with is a screen that is slightly taller than the 8S, but also slightly narrower. You have virtually the same amount of screen. Unfortunately, watching video in full screen leaves a section cut-out on the side or the other option is to center the video, giving you a much smaller viewing area with black bars on all four sides than if you were watching the same video on the 8S.
The build of the phone is trumped-up to be ""surgical grade steel"" and ""the hardest glass ever on a phone."" Watch the drop-tests to see how easily the glass breaks and see how slippery the ""surgical grade steel"" is to hold onto. You will definitely want a case for your handset. Break the back of your phone? Apple will charge you over $500 to repair it!
While the processors and memory run quite efficiently with IOS (the best feature of an iPhone), IOS itself has become buggier with each iteration. Autocorrect has gone bonkers with IOS 11, autocorrecting words for no apparent reason or changing letters on you.
It's great that Apple has ""gotten with the times"" and offers fast charging and wireless charging. Unfortunately, the charger included in the box isn't a fast charger - there is a separate charge for that. Same goes for the Wireless charging.
Apple is really pushing AR (augmented reality) as if they invented it. AR has been around for years and is much simpler than VR (virtual reality). You've probably been using AR for years without even realizing that is what it was. Such as apps like Messenger or Snapchat putting hats on your head or making you puke a rainbow. Or hunting Pokémon where you see the Pokémon in the real world through your camera's viewfinder. Yep, that's AR and it's been around. When Apple lets you strap a VR headset to your face and explore get back to me.
All in all, the phone is a nice next step from Apple and they are finally getting with the times. But it's not the greatest phone ever made nor the greatest iPhone ever made.",att.com
iphone,5,"This phone is amazing! I was a bit skeptical getting it because it didn't have the Home button. I thought it would take a couple weeks getting use to the phone, but after the 2nd day I'm good. It is a natural function using the swipe for changing apps and navigating the UI. The battery life so far is lasting more than a day with continuous use. Switching from the iPhone 7 Plus to the X was the easist switch ever. Within half an hour I was up and running. It was worth the wait.",att.com
iphone,1,I’ve had every iPhone since 2007 and this iPhone is by far the most overpriced overrated iPhone ever. I used the phone for only an hour before boxing it back up to return. I’ll wait for Apple to come out with a new plus sized iPhone X. Until then I got a Note 8.,att.com
iphone,5,"I was using the 6plus for the last three years. This was a leap for the money. Have to say I like the slightly smaller size even though the screen is about the same height but a bit narrower than the plus. The two biggest improvements, besides the speed which is very fast, is Face ID. Super fast even in low light and great that it works in most of my locked apps. Other great feature is no home button. Just a flick up from the bottom opens home from any app and swipe down from upper right to access camera and calculator screen.",att.com
iphone,4,"it’s different. 7plus has been, by far, my favorite iPhone incarnation. I was given X for my birthday and I feel like I went back to a 4 because of its size. Since we have been with iPhone since it’s inception, I feel somewhat obligated to give the X a chance. I’m really missing my 7 plus though so I don’t know if I’ll give X to my son or not",att.com
iphone,5,"I absolute love everything about this phone. I was so hesitant to get it I also settled for the 8, but I am big on photo quality and this phone beats all my expectations. Well worth the price by all means. The only thing I dislike is that since it's all glass it feels very slippery and fragile to the touch, but it's nothing a good case can't fix.",att.com
iphone,5,"I was skeptical of the iPhone X at first because of it’s cost and the fact that it was all glass. After reading reviews online, I decided to try the phone out and return it if I didn’t like it without risk thanks to AT&T’s good return policy for online purchases. I’ve had the phone now for a little over a week now and I absolutely love it. It’s so easy to use and moves so smoothly. The screen is amazing. The phone looks amazing and still feels sturdy even though it is made of glass! I will be keeping this phone. I love it!",att.com
iphone,1,"It's Terrible. Everyone that I speak to (on the phone) says that it sounds as if I am underwater before the crackling begins and I have to hang up . Now, I have to return the phone within the 2 week window of purchase which is a real inconvenience for me as I have a broken leg that I can't bear any weight on.",att.com
iphone,5,Absolutely love this iPhone! So glad it’s a full screen iPhone! I was thinking about switching back to the galaxy before I heard rumors of the iPhone X and I’m so glad I held off and waited! It was so easy to get use to the new gestures. Within a day it become natural! I still at times reach for the home button since I was so use to it though. I would definitely recommend this phone! I do wish the battery life was a little better though. I came from the 7 plus and actually prefer the size of the x better than the plus!,att.com
iphone,5,I like the iPhone X because it provides a slightly larger screen without being as big as some of the other models (i.e. it still fits in my clutch). It took a minute to get used to the phone not having the home button or ear phone port. It does come with the dongle but we went ahead and purchased the blue tooth ear pods.,att.com
iphone,5,"I love my iphone 10! I actually prefer the size of the 10, not too big nor too small! The camera is absolutely phenomenal!!! Facial recognition work quickly and recognizes me with my glasses on! I know it’s pricey but so worth it! Oh and the battery life is great as well! Overall I’m pleased with Apple this time around!",att.com
iphone,1,"After two days my phone stopped being touch sensitive and recognizing my face. I restarted it mutiple times and had to spend three hours at a store to get it fixed!! It was brand new and had no reason to stop functioning. Overall, I should have just kept my old phone.",att.com
iphone,1,"Not happy at all with this phone. First iPhone I’m not pleased with. It freezes and it has kinks in it when scrolling through photos sent through messages, for example. It’s more like an Android freezing up than a smooth iPhone. I regret getting it and wish I had gone 8 plus. I’ve had this phone for four months. :-(",att.com
iphone,5,I got my wife her I-Phone X and she loves it. I was not as sold on the phone as the access changes to the phone (without the button) seemed a little odd. Man oh man was I wrong. Apple made this phone with easability in mind. Accessing my screen is so much easier and more efficient. The camera is TRULY AMAZING! And the Space Gray color is really cutting edge in design. I am a very very satisfied customer and equally satisfied with this phone. I havent even began to know all this phone can do. You WILL be satisfied.,att.com
iphone,4,"I have only owned it since Saturday and haven’t used all the functions yet but what I have used is impressive. Speakers sound better than my iPhone 6 , face recognition is neat, a little heavier than my 6. I have owned iPhones since the 3 and they keep getting better. Not sure that they should be called phones anymore but really - the phone accounts for a minor part of functionality. Apple should have a contest to rename the iphone.",att.com
iphone,5,"Received the ten on launch day, it took a couple days to get use to but overall I was satisfied. It wasn't until I had to use my 7 Plus again to reset it that I really noticed a difference; the 7 Plus seemed old. The gestures of the ten really make the 7 Plus seemed as if it came out 3-4 years ago and not one.
The battery is better than I thought and what many have told me, the phone is a little thicker and heavier than my previous but you get use to it quickly.
Overall I'm very happy and would recommend.",att.com
iphone,3,"I have been an Iphone user for 5 years or so. The X is my third Iphone. I love the size of it and my 4 year old LOVES the animated emoji thing. The camera is really good, but doesn't feel much different than the camera on the 8. What is very different is not having a home button. One of the biggest reasons I miss it is that you HAVE to pick up your phone to access the home page. You can't just put your finger on the home button to be recognized. You have to pick it up so your facial recognition will work. One other thing that I don't think any of the engineers thought about - SWIPING UP FOR EVERYTHING CAN CAUSE FOREARM FATIGUE! Think about it, pressing a button with your thumb is a lot easier than moving your hole thumb 1 to 2 inches up 1000 times throughout the day. I have had the phone for 2 weeks or so, but I have noticed that on days I've used the phone a lot that my right forearm is tired.
All in all it's a cool phone. But I wish they had left the home button alone.",att.com
iphone,2,"I had a Samsung S8 before I got a IPhone because everyone say it was better. Big lie!!! Small screen, no finger print, gps sucks, notifications are annoying you need to go one by one to delete them instead of just slide them I can’t download a lot of apps the system of Apple make the use of the phone slow. I miss the finger print. Many of my old videos I transfer over I can’t watch them because they aren’t iPhone videos. Many of the apps that I like to use before free of charge I’m froze to start paying",att.com
iphone,2,"I should have know better. Been buying iPhones since day one. They have been real misses the past few years. I thought I’d give it one last go. Nope! The screen is full size. Aside from that...same old phone. Don’t waste your money. This thing is waaaaaaaay to expensive for you to be disappointed.
The customer service at AT&T was outstanding however. That is something I really appreciated.
While filling out the survey here it only lists online, store and other. I chose other because I called them and ordered the phone. I say this so you know my issues with the phone aren’t because I bought some knock off from a guy on the internet when you see “other”.
Good luck. Consider an 8 or maybe even a 7. Spend the rest of the money on something better! Hope this helps.",att.com
iphone,3,I used to have the S8+ the screen is bigger and the phone is lighter. The iPhone X is heavy compared to other iPhones. I do like the Face ID. I’m not blown away by this phone and the camera is still not as good as android. I don’t hate the phone but don’t love it either.,att.com
iphone,5,It has been almost a week since upgrading from the 6S to the X. I’m pleased with the battery life compared to the 6S and obviously the numerous other upgrades that come with the phone. It takes some getting used to going from having the touch button to face recognition.,att.com
iphone,4,I went from Samsung to the new iPhone 8 and loved it enough that when my oldest wanted an I phone 8 I up graded to the IPhone X. It take a little bit to get use to no home button and the battery doesn’t seem to stay charged as long as the 8 but overall it’s a great phone,att.com
iphone,4,An easy switch from the iPhone style before. Gestures and face scan are very quick and easy to learn. Have noticed a few glitches with the software. Bottom bar where the four apps are don’t load sometimes and time on the lock screen disappears and I have to restart phone to get it back. That and random other glitches which are expected with a first iteration of a phone aren’t deal breakers. All in all a good phone with a great camera.,att.com
iphone,3,"The phone itself is amazing the problem is the battery. I have to have the brightness almost all the way down and can’t really mess with it very much in order for it to last the whole day. It’s a powerhouse phone though, just be prepared to be chained to a wall outlet.",att.com

iphone,5,I have the hands of a child so it’s nice to have the screen size but ability to hold it. It takes some getting used to but it’s worth it. The only negative is having to pick your phone up for Face ID. Aside from that the phone is beautiful and amazing photos!,att.com

iphone,1,I’m a big customer of ATT and after 5 days of stress with a defective screen I was told to go to apple. Apple said I should go to ATT. Att is supposedly exchange a bad phone after a few days and would not do it. Or offer a full refund. I wasted days.,att.com

The notch everyone complains about is barely noticeable after the first 2 minutes of use. The camera is awesome and has cool features (4K video). Also, the swiping motions are far more natural than the home button. It’s sad more people aren’t buying this phone and that Apple is rumored to be discontinuing it this summer.",att.com
iphone,5,"I bought the X after having a 6 Plus and have been very happy with it. The size is better, it looks better with glass on the front and the back and the functionality is easy to grasp. One of the aspects I like is the removal of the home button. It used to get fingerprints on it and wouldn’t work so I had to use the passcode which was a pain. Now, I just hold the phone up and it works due to facial recognition. If you are willing to pay the hefty price tag, I highly recommend the iPhone X.",att.com
iphone,5,This phone is one of the better phones to have if your a smart person.

The initial adjustment to facial recognition from finger biometrics was pretty quick. Also, I’m surprised at how much more responsive Siri is. I never really used it that often in the past cause well Siri was garbage. I enjoyed the couple weeks I had the X now and hope to enjoy it for the next few years.",att.com
iphone,4,"I like the quality of the phone. It’s clearly better than any other iPhone. I like the bigger screen. The only thing I don’t like is that you have to have to have your face in front of phone to unlock it, which you did not have to do when there was a fingerprint. I also don’t like that you can’t just swipe the windows to close them anymore which is easier than the way you have to do it now. You have to hold it and hit the x on top to close each one. Takes more time. And it’s annoying",att.com

I wish I could store more than one version of myself, because I had to choose between wearing glasses or not wearing them, but that’s not the end of the world.

There’s a bit of a learning curve, just like with any new device, but it does everything that’s important to me, and has a few extra features to boot.",att.com
iphone,5,I love it The best phone ever The Face ID change the concept of password This is a phone without a password But that facility is only for the owner of the phone Terrific,att.com
iphone,5,I’ve had an iPhone on and off since 2010. I’ve been the girl who would go back and forth through Samsung and iPhone. And overall I’m sticking with iPhone. I just switch from the note 8 and even though I lived the note 8 I had to go back to apple and get the X ive had this phone for a week and I am very impressed with the phone. The Face ID works great even in very low light. It’s worked about 98% of the time which was about the same for me as Touch ID. Of course when it does work just put in the passcode. The phone fits great in my hand. I like how it’s small like the 8 but the screen is BIGGER than the 8 plus even if it doesn’t seem like it. The cameras are amazing as usual and the Animoji feature is so much fun. I did have a slight problem after the 3 day. The screen went black and took 10 mins to turn back on. I was about to return but I realized it needed an update and it’s been working fin ever since. I do think the price of the phone needs to be lower and it was hyped up a little too much but over all I love it. Ppl wanted a change from apple and now they got it. Just keep in mind that no phone is perfect.,att.com

iphone,2,"I use to bean android guy, and first tasteof iPhone in when the 6s came out loved it. But this iPhone x is like the same thing no different features nothing up apart from facial recognition and the home button is gone. Its not worth the money, too expensive. Thought for sure there would be alot more to it. Not to mention the front camera is no better than it has been already poor apple!!!",att.com

iphone,1,Battery is absolutely horrible! They take away more and more each time no fingerprint scanner and hardware is glitchy and quite slow not impressed,att.com
iphone,4,"I was like most people when the design was first released. I was worried about the notch being bothersome or obstructing your view on the screen. It seems that it’s hardly noticaeble. I also figured it would take time to get used to not having a home button. That seems to not be the case either. I’m really impressed with how it felt natural without it. This iPhone is absolutely gorgeous. The price may be expensive, maybe even too expensive, but I feel that the phone is built very very well. Only issue, being the glass back, but so far I’ve had a couple of drops, thankfully no shatters with a Speck case from Wal-Mart.
The battery sort of dissappoints me sometimes.. Some days, however, I’m very impressed with the battery. It typically depends on my usage. It gets me through the day, more so than my iPhone 7 Plus did.
Speaking of which, I’d picked up my 7 Plus the other day after using this phone for over a week now and it feels like a brick. Lol I like the smaller design, the screen is slightly bigger than the plus and edge to edge display, I really love this phone so far. I would recommend getting one if it is within your budget.",att.com

iphone,3,"I hate to say it, but coming from a plus phone this is not my ideal size. I like the phone, but definitely wish it were larger. I think it was a bad choice for  not to make the phone available in a larger phone. I realize there is a larger viewing screen but I prefer the larger phone. If I had to do it all over again I would have probably just gotten the 8 Plus. I did have that option but at the time I figured the size wouldn’t be a problem but I sure do miss my 6S Plus.",att.com
iphone,2,"I do not like that the finger scan is no longer an option. The facial scan is not always working. The previous iPhone would allow you to touch the screen while watching something to give you the time, this has been removed.

iphone,4,"I am getting use to the X. I like the facial recognition feature works great. The only thing I actually was shocked with was the size. Even though it has a bigger screen, most apps don’t use the whole screen and I thought the phone would have been bigger. I had an iPhone 7plus and I actually liked the size and feel of it. Just wish the X was bigger. I also would love to be an Apple product tester, I would love to test and give feedback and ideas on Apple products.",att.com

Im not sure if this is a new feature on the iPhone X but i can assume it is not. The expectation of a new phone is that it is in pristine quality. Now if i want to replace it i have to pay additional costs, my previous phone of three years had not damage on the screen and right out of the box I've got some damage.",att.com

iphone,5,"I'd read a few negative reviews, but I think they were paid to write them. This phone is nothing short of amazing. I'd been using the + size prior to this, and while the case is smaller, the screen size is actually slightly bigger (length). The new gestures were easy to pick up quickly, and face recognition is nothing short of amazing, even in low light. I was a bit leery of buying this phone initially, but no regrets at all. The camera is fantastic as well.",att.com

The photos, the ease of swapping from one phone to the next... ease of navigation and battery life... I could go on and on.

At first it feels weird not to have a home button, but I got used to it after a day and now I feel like the home button is archaic.
I got the 256 GB version and thats worth the value (not much difference from 64 GB).
Only con is I wish for a larger plus screen size.",att.com

iphone,1,Don’t like it too much swiping to open phone,att.com
iphone,2,"I upgraded from iPhone 7Plus and I am regretting it. The X is very small compared to 7Plus and holding the X simply is undesirable. The keyboard has entirely too much wasted space and still without multitask keys. FaceID works without any issue and is quick! However, the bottom line is...it’s still just an iPhone",att.com
iphone,3,I think way to much money for just o phone,att.com
iphone,5,"I have to say I myself am very impressed with the iPhone. For those coming from anything “plus” yes it will initially feel smaller. But you will quickly find that you fall in love with the speed and easy use of the phone so that you stop noticing the size difference. The screen is the most crisp it has ever been, with a beautiful display. If all else falls just open the camera... apple has truly outdone itself with the best camera to ever hit a apple device.",att.com
iphone,3,Way to much money for hype that just isn't there returning for a cheaper same quality phone.,att.com
iphone,5,"Amazing phone! It has a lot of android similarities except it is on the Apple/Mac platform. My reasons to purchase the iPhone X was, I wanted a large screen without a large phone. With the edge-to-edge screen, you get the iPhone 6/7/8 overall size with the screen of an iPhone 8 Plus. the picture/screen quality is amazing and the battery last all day with moderate video watching. As expected, all my important data is available on my phone, MacBook, and iPad through my Apple ID and I can text and talk through all 3 devices when connected to the same WiFi. I also enjoy the ease of FaceTime with my young son when I am on travel or overseas. While there are other mediums to video chat, none can compare to the audio and video quality of FaceTime. I am completely satisfied with the iPhone X and well stay with Apple for years to come.",att.com
iphone,5,"Bought the phone against reviews. Wondered if I'd adjust to no home button at the bottom. I use voiceover almost daily when I walk to listen to my Kindle books. Had to go back and have them help me -- but it works even better than my other iPhone. I try to stay knowledgeable concerning electronics or else life will pass me by. I am finding I have adjusted to the iPhone 10. It is an easy size to hold and use with one hand. I think it looks ""classy"".",att.com
iphone,2,"The swipe down from upper right of the screen is the main change i don't appreciate. The volume in maximum mode is WAY too loud. I have anxiety and jump when my phone goes off if its at max volume. The change from ""Wednesday"" to ""Wed"" on the calendar app icon is not necessary. And why isn't there an AM or PM for the time while I'm in the phone? The absence of a headphone jack is depressing.",att.com
iphone,2,I didn't like the iPhone X I'm glad I returned it it was disappointing all the way around I went back to my plus size iPhone 8 plus I love it way better only thing was good about the iPhone X was the speed and camera all the hype is gone about the iPhone X as a iPhone user if you love the plus size stick it with it iPhone X will not be for you.,att.com
iphone,5,This is a major overhaul from previous models. It’s fast! You get more screen from a smaller handset. The gestures became second nature to me within 2 days. Everything is so fluid in terms of switching apps or tasks. There are new things to learn in terms of how to take screenshots or do a hard reset. Accessing the control center is easy from the top right hand corner. The notch in the screen doesn’t bother me a bit. I do not miss the bulk of my 6+. I’m a woman with smaller hands and it’s still easy to operate the phone with one hand. I understand there is an iPhone XL coming but I am over carrying around a bulky phone. Also the phone is a beautiful piece of eye candy but did I mention it’s fast!!! Also the addition of wireless charging is a huge bonus. I am thoroughly happy with my IPX & find that I can’t put it down.,att.com
iphone,5,I’m not by any means an Apple cult member. I own all PC computers and I detest iTunes witj a passion. I got the iPhone X Because I was due for an upgrade from my 6+. So just to let you know this thing is great. Slightly smaller size I thought I wouldn’t like but it really fits in the hand much better and all the new gestures make this thing great for a single thumb use. And the battery life is amazing. Go ahead spend a lil extra you’ll be glad you did.,att.com
iphone,5,"This phone is awesome!!! I love the slimness . I can reach across it with one hand. I love the glass & chrome, very unique . And I don’t miss the back button at all . I have a clear case so I can see the phone . And the Animoji’s we have laughed till we cried lol plus I’m still learning lots of fun & interesting things about it everyday.",att.com
iphone,2,The phone shutz down by itself. It doesn't send out message. Juz horrible phone.,att.com
iphone,5,"This is a really good phone for anyone, however the battery is not that great. It's going to be challenging the week, while you get used to learning how to maneuver around the phone without a button. I would say look at youtu hmmm e reviews and videos before you buy the phone as well. The phone has froze a couple times and it takes a few minutes to unfreeze because there is no button. I haven't figured out how to restart it without the button yet.",att.com
iphone,4,Well overall the phone itself is wonderful. They are pros and cons to all new technology. I like the phone is heavier so it seems more sturdy and the clarity of the pictures and videos due to the camera upgrades are great. One of the few cons I see is that the entire phone is made of glass which makes me very nervous about dropping it. Don’t believe the hype of the video on the web or you can just take it and throw it. I would advise against that.,att.com
iphone,4,"This phone seems to work good, just needs to be more durable and the battery percentage back. Price is too high and apple didn’t add a lot of features for the price. I feel like a lot more people would use apple if it was more customizable and could add personal stuff and music and ringtones without having to use iTunes. Also it seems like iTunes has fewer options and harder to navigate every time it has an update. Overall, it seems to be alright.",att.com
iphone,5,"The iPhone X is lighting fast with the A-11 processor. Computing now is becoming an ""extension"" of you, the user rather than a device to be clumsy with. The face recognition is flawless, and remains flawless among your apps---even in the dark. The iPhone X is heavy to the feel, representing the integrity of the build and materials utilized. The AR (augmented reality) chips combined with Haptic (touch, feel, movement et al) make experiential things fun and productive----AR apps are specifically available. I had the 5, and two 6S and they were fine------the X takes a device to a new level of human/ machine interface. The wireless charging works through ""inductive"" technology. It works better than I imagined due to the physical design of the battery, and works well through my Tech 21 clear case. Apple's OWN charging solution will be nice as to support 3 devices charging at once. 7.5 Watts is the power coming from a Belkin Boost wireless charger. Some chargers boast 15 watts but the iPhone is set by Apple to utilize only 7.5 watts. I believe that they do this because the battery could get warm, and then limit itself by design to 80% charge capacity until in a cooler environment. I would recommend utilizing the manufacturer's recommended wireless charging solution---is simple, as is almost everything about this phone.",att.com
iphone,5,"I am thoroughly enjoying getting to know my new phone. Once again, Apple has created a fun to use phone that still gives me a little challenge as I navigate the improvements. The face recognition is so cool and much more accurate than the fingerprint recognition ever was. The slight increase in size over the 7 is just right. I was not planning on a new phone, but with some slight issues with my 7, I am glad I made the change. The X is incredible!",att.com
iphone,4,"What can I say.....it is a really nice device. Does it live up to the hype, I am not sure just yet. With all of the tech, it will be a device of the future. I have not had any issues with the face ID as has been reported on a few reviews. However, need more apps to be updated to take advantage of everything the phone can do.",att.com
iphone,5,"I have just gone from an iPhone 4s to the iPhone X. It is like learning all over again what a iPhone can do. With the help of my granddaughters (10 & 12) I now feel pretty comfortable with the new iPhone X. However, there's still a number of things I need to learn before I consider myself confident to explain them to others.",att.com
iphone,5,This phone is absolutely amazing. I bought it for the camera. I take pictures all the time and the pictures are fantastic. I come from an iPhone 6s Plus and I think the iPhone X size is perfect. The screen is extremely clear. Btw I’m not over exaggerating. This is a great phone! I think people just want to complain to complain.,att.com
iphone,2,"I bought this phone for my son two weeks ago. We have to return it already because he keeps getting green lines across his screen. We called Apple help and they stayed on the phone for over an hour and then told him he needed to talk it in to get it replaced. However, there were no appts avail at the locations for weeks.",att.com
iphone,3,"The iPhone X is simply a very overpriced piece of hardware. I jump between Android and iOS often, it seems Samsung, OnePlus, Google, Huawei, even LG are catching up or in some cases pulling ahead of Apple's innovation. Apple has done a tremendous job building their brand to the extent if you would place the Apple logo on some of the devices built by the manufacturers listed above people would lose their minds. Now back to the iPhone X, it is basically an iPhone 7 Plus with the exception of a smaller body, infinity screen, wireless charging, and facial recognition. Let's face it, Apple is late to the game with most of those features. Unfortunately, I am stuck paying $33.34/month for an underwhelming device with an iPhone 7 Plus-like performance. This is just my opinion and it comes down to the price of the hardware and what is available on the market at a lower price point. If Apple bumped the price down $150-$200 I would probably increase my rating to 4, not 3 stars.",att.com
iphone,1,Hate the size!!!! Way to small compared to the iPhone 7 Plus.,att.com
iphone,5,"I am more than pleased with my new X! I previously had the 7 plus which I loved BUT the X is the perfect size to manage with one hand again which is the one thing I missed going to the plus. No home button, no problem, it was a quick and easy adjustment. I only miss the percentage option for battery indicator. OVERALL SOLID DEVICE! I’ve had every phone since 3g iPhone!",att.com
iphone,4,"The iPhone X is a very high tech phone. It has been quite the adjustment getting used to the home button not being there. There’s a few changes from the old iPhone features that I’m not a fan of. Such as, the battery percentage not displaying unless you pull down the control panel. I also feel like the system runs dramatically slower than the previous iPhones I’ve had over the years. But overall, I am impressed with all of the positives.",att.com
iphone,3,"The phone is fine, but it needs the touch button also it’s sort of tricky to use. Before I’d just tap the button now I have to keep tapping the screen till it lites up. Now every time I log into an app. I have to use the passcode, before the print was one and done. I should of just kept the iPhone 6 ........,",att.com
iphone,5,"The phone has been amazing, another triumph for Apple. There is a learning curve on this phone as the home button has been replaced with gestures and swipes on the screen. I am technologically oriented so I picked all this up quickly, for many there will be a learning curve from the traditional iPhone. The screen is amazingly crisp, clear and precise. Photos are great with both the telephoto and portrait cameras being image stabilized.",att.com
iphone,5,"I traded in my iPhone 7 Plus for the iPhone X over two weeks ago and I have been satisfied completely, if not more. I was worried about the physical size of the phone, but, compared to my iPhone 7 Plus I was trading in, the screen size of the iPhone X is exactly the same as the iPhone 7 Plus. Within hours, I adjusted quickly to not having a home button. The speed of the phone is great, along with the cameras. The pictures are amazing.",att.com
iphone,5,"After my 7 plus red went for a swim in 4th of July I ended up having to go back to an android which was awful! I went last week and purchased an X, and absolutely love it! I love the features as well as the size of the phone. The screen itself is the same size as a plus, just on a smaller phone since the screen is the entire phone. Apple has hit it out of the park again! Can’t wait to see what they come out with next! Thank you Apple!",att.com
iphone,5,"The iPhone X is a great phone. The sleek design and the full screen is incomparable to all other iPhones. The only thing con is the face recognition . It’s not as easy as putting your finger to unlock . You have to look at the screen or be facing toward it . So for those of us who like to unlock our phone while our face is buried in a pillow, it makes us get up and face the screen. Other than that I love this phone and glad I got it",att.com
iphone,2,"I wish I had not traded my IPhone 6s+:( no home button, transfer of contacts didn’t work completely, my sister and bro-in-law got IPhone 8, much happier.

iphone,5,I preordered my iPhone X and it arrived earlier then quoted. It is the best phone I’ve ever owned. Everything is so smooth and fluent. No issues whatsoever. OLED display is amazing. Wireless charging is superb. My iPhone charges to 50% in 25min. I don’t have to charge it overnight anymore and no more cables. I even bought a dust plug for lightning port since I don’t intend of using it. Lol. Face ID is amazingly fast and accurate. Tried it on my whole family and it only unlocks on me. The key is to do a face scan in a well lit room and hold the phone at the level you usually use to view it on. The size is perfect. Fits my pants front pocket better then iPhone 7 Plus. Cameras are great. New Animojis are fun. I highly recommend iPhone X. If you are on Next plan the difference between iPhone 7 Plus 256gb and new iPhone X is only $1.69 a month. Well worth it.,att.com
iphone,5,I've had iPhones since the first generation and this is by far the best one yet. The display is very clear and bright and it's the perfect size for me. It did take me a while to adjust to the new controls. Having the facial recognition instead of the fingerprint reader on the home button was a change. Now that I'm used to it I really like it. The facial recognition on apps is super convenient. Battery life is also very good.,att.com

iphone,5,"It’s cool, I don’t know why they would Discontinue the phone because it is extremely accessible the only thing that I really don’t care for it is it seems as if my battery dies fairly quickly rather than that it was well worth the purchase if you are up on technology I would say go ahead and get the X but if you are one of the people that live in the Stone Age or under a rock. do not get the iPhone X and expected to cure cancer",att.com

iphone,1,I did not like the IPhone X at all. It is not user friendly to me. I was just not comfortable with the size overall. The screen was great but I was disappointed. I shipped it back to get a different cell phone!,att.com
iphone,5,"What I love: - The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black). - The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it. - The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my pockets. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 7. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store. - I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 7 was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth. - Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way. - The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera. - The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening. - The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it.",att.com
iphone,3,Face detection vs finger print reader isn’t even close. It feels like the product was rushed to bring to market without a home button. Lots of things are good about the phone but LOTS of bad. Screen is great however the gestures could be a lot better. The phone feels like it questions what you want it to do. Flipping between apps takes more time. Unlocking your phone when you’re not looking right at it isn’t great.,att.com

iphone,5,I upgraded from the iPhone 7s. It is definitely a better model iPhone. The battery is a major upgrade and I love that it stays charge so much longer. The facial recognition is different from the thumb scan but it’s not a negative feature. The only thing that’s an adjustment is the way to take a screen shot. Sometimes I accidentally take screenshots. Other than that it is a lot better than the iPhone 7s.,att.com
iphone,2,"Just not really worth it. I upgraded because my 7 broke...hard getting used to the new operating commands and the size is larger than necessary...it’s a phone, not an iPad. Anyway, no other real surprises...just more of the same...",att.com
iphone,4,"Upgraded my 8 plus to the IPhone X everything I expected it to be but for just one shortfall.... Battery life.... Slightly smaller feel in comparison to my former 8 plus even with my Otterbox case...easy navigation, the facial recognition is a great plus and no more fussing with the finger ID. And of course the Great Service and personal attention you get when you go to your Corporate AT&T Store.",att.com
iphone,3,"I got the phone as an upgrade from my 7 plus. I am usually super impressed with the new phones. This one, not so much. I am not a fan of the camera nor the buttonless screen. I also was very comfortable with my the size of my old phone.. but the X is just weird. I havent been a fan of recent apple products, and I guess I am not a fan of the new phone either. Maybe if there was a 10 plus? Who knows?",att.com
iphone,1,I cant say many thing good abut this phone nothing wrong with phone i thing software not like befor i mean i phone 7 was the best after 8 and this have many problam when i have i phone sevan evan last five month dont good.,att.com
iphone,5,"I was very reluctant to buy this phone because of some negative feedback on the missing home button, the new Face ID recognition etc etc. I got so used to not having the home button that this new swiping as a hint me but is way better besides that the screen is all the he way around. In addition, the face recognition is great to sign on to all my accounts. I recommend the IPhone X. Great phone.",att.com
iphone,5,"This is a great new phone and the path to the future. Cool new features (I know Samsung had most of them already), but now Apple does it with flair. If you don't like change, you wont like it, but get used to change!",att.com
iphone,5,Love the phone it has great battery life !! Nice and sleek fit!! Face ID is super amazing quick and easy to access the phone. The switching around of the features definitely gives it a level up its still the same iPhone just with a twist it made it fun to relearn the functions of the X. It made the experience new completely. I am taking it for what it is and enjoying it Apple is truly THE BEST,att.com
iphone,5,It is hard getting use to the New IPhone and it’s features so many to choose from but now that I have gotten use to them I am absolutely in love with it and if you come right down to it it’s the best IPHONE EVER if you reading this definitely buy it and Apple isn’t playing me to say this I have always had an Android phone and I like them but my Iphone is the best phone I have ever had !!!!!!!,att.com
iphone,5,I absolutely LOVE my iPhone X!! The face recognition is extremely fast! Then only thing I don’t like is after the face recognition unlocks the phone you still have to swipe up to open the phone. The processor is extremely fast! I don’t like how small the phone is. The notch doesn’t bother me at all and not having a home button took maybe 8 hours to get used to. Overall a great purchase!,att.com
iphone,5,"I’ve always evolved with the sizes of the iphones over the years. I just switched from my iPhone 7 to the iPhone X. It’s prefect, I could never get feel for a plus that feels like a mini iPad. So the C is just right. Getting us eto the changes as well. I love how sleek it is and I have a case that doesn’t hide that. Overall I love my new phone and I’d recommend it to fellow apple users!",att.com
iphone,2,"Not impressed at all with the x, I’m miss my 6plus may be trading it back in and try the moto, I like their accesorie option. Apple need to step their game up... I give it a 6 out of 10 at best",att.com
iphone,5,"Love the camera on new phone. Of course, night photos are still not good but they day ones are perfect. Screen and size of the phone is perfect. I was little concerned about not having button but it is super easy to transition. Another con is that some of the applications don’t seem to be adjusted for the X, like viber and cannon app I use for my camera, other than that, awesomness :)",att.com
iphone,1,Why is it smaller than a plus? I don’t get it. Even the face recognition gets annoying. Not my smartest purchase.,att.com
iphone,3,If you’re looking for something new.... don’t spend the money on the IPhone X. Get the 8 or stick with your 7 Plus. Not enough features to warrant the cost of. Save the money and take a cruise.,att.com
iphone,5,"The phone is great! I can do everything I have in the past with my other phones, but now I don’t need to use my finger to punch in a code or to use my finger print. At first it feels weird to hold a smaller unit compares to the iPhone Plus models, but surprisingly the screen is bigger... mind blowing!
I can go on and on, but it is best for you to get your hands on one and enjoy.",att.com
iphone,2,I am going to return it and get the 8 the only difference about this phone is the home button is gone and the facial recognition. Since I am use to the the Plus this phone is also too small.,att.com
iphone,5,"I absolutely love my phone! It's so fun and so glad I finally upgraded. With all my facial changes (make up, eye glasses etc) I noticed that my phone doesn't unlock all the time like it's supposed to or like it did initially at least. That's slightly disappointing.. Although the camera quality is REMARKABLE. The design and sleekness of the phone is great. Glad i made the decision.",att.com
iphone,5,I usually don't write reviews and how this helps someone out. I've had iPhones since the very first one and battery life has always been the biggest issue for me as I use my phone all day for work. But the iPhone X has an incredible battery life. Now I can use the phone all day and at midnight still have around 30-40%. That alone justifies the price these things cost these days!!,att.com
iphone,4,"The new X is well worth the money. Very fast and the new additions are very fun. Just wish with all the money the X cost a customer,that Apple would offer air pods or a better headset",att.com
iphone,5,Excellent phone works really well especially in the dark the face recognition is amazing. compared to the other phones they did it a little better on the battery. love this new phone.,att.com
iphone,5,"Apple iPhone X is a great phone. Specially when facial recognition comes in handy with Apple Pay in certain places. Also, I like the fact the screen is bigger for my huge hands! Also, I like the fact how, I’m not over hitting letters when I actually meant the other letter. I like how the flashlight when I turn the phone on to get light for walking in the movies comes in handy.",att.com
iphone,5,"I’ve had the iPhone 3GS 4s 5c 6+ 7+ and now the X. It’s the best one of all of them. I had issues with the 4s battery, 5c build 6+ and 7+ being buggy and have had no issues with the X. It remind of the 4s solid premium feeling phone good weight to it ...faceid is great I can’t imagine using touchid ever again. My only gripe is the notch I hate it but other than that it’s great",att.com
iphone,1,I went from an iPhone 6 Plus to the iPhone X. The display and sound quality from the phone is awesome! I love the Face ID and Animojis! Switching was definitely a good choice.,att.com
iphone,5,Face recognition is awesome. Love the screen and the size is just right.,att.com
iphone,4,"Great phone, very quick with a slight learning curve. It does everything they claim! Great sound, I replaced my 6s with it and the difference feels like a decade! a bit on the expensive side, I was needing a new phone and my gut tells me another Xs or 11 is coming soon...the price for the newest technology I guess. Def a great buy, it lives up to the hype if you have the $$$",att.com
iphone,5,"Can’t think of any flaws in this iPhone X. Speakers and sound are perfect. Typing ability-smooth and easy and accurate. User interface very intuitive and powerful and efficient. Camera is Also wonderful with super clear and beautiful photos and videos. Very easy to use functions. Beautifully clear, bright and large-enough screen. Love the 256gb storage. Sharp looking design.",att.com
iphone,4,"Big upgrade over my IPhone 6s, but very pricey. Needs to have lower price, Apple isn’t hurting that much. Notch on top is very distracting, needs to go on future models. Apple needs to figure that one it. Pretty loyal Apple consumer, nice to upgrade but could have had a lot more improvements. Also needs to incorporate a stylus like Samsung, believe me would sell like crazy.",att.com
iphone,5,"Perfect phone for most hands, great display, very fast. Make sure to buy a good cover and screen protector, 'cause if it is dropped, it isn't going to be cheap to fix.",att.com
iphone,4,"Like all the other iPhones that I've owned, this phone functions perfectly. I've even got used to working without a home button fairly quickly. My only negative opinion at this time is the missing zoom for texting and the icons on the home page. That was a great feature on my other iPhones and can't think of a good reason why this feature was discontinued on the iPhone X.",att.com
iphone,5,"I was worried about the price and size since my last phone was 6 plus, but actually kind of nice to go smaller. There is a greenish hugh around edge but I think it's from the glass. Doesn't seem to effect anything. Not sure if it's a flaw? Been looking on reviews but no one has posted an issue with it. Face recognition is nice. All in all nice phone and have lots to learn",att.com
iphone,5,"I am absolutely thrilled with this phone! I was a little hesitant at first - converting from an iPhone 7, but the lack of a home button has been no problem at all! It is super easy to use, the camera is phenomenal, and there are lots of neat little features I continue to discover! I would recommend this phone to anyone considering an upgrade! The larger screen is amazing!",att.com
iphone,2,"Full disclosure: I am coming from a Galaxy S8. Now that info is out of the way I truly believe the IPhone X is leap years behind android. I have owned my IPhone 6s for a few years now and love it! The difference is the price point. I’m ok with a few quirks and a few missing features at half the price. I expect perfection at the price point this phone comes in at. And to be perfectly clear, the build quality and camera are amazing! Sadly, that’s about where the greatness wears off with this device. There are so many dozens of useful features missing from this device that any android device would have its laughable. That would be entirely due to Apple wanting to play it safe and make your device dummy proof. There isn’t even an actual file system that’s accessible to the user!! All in all, I can say with confidence stay far away f I’m this device. Save your money and get a flagship android device. You’ll be glad you did.",att.com
iphone,3,"I went from an Iphone6S Plus to the X, and while the phone has some cool new features my biggest complaint is missing the home key- I am constantly turning on Siri and taking screen shot because I hold the phone by the sides and the buttons on the side perform same actions as the home button once did. I’ve onky had the phone 2 weeks .. possible I’ll get use to it ?",att.com
iphone,5,"The iPhone X is great. I loved my iPhone 7 and it served me well, but after upgrading, I wouldn't go back without a fight. I think everyone who hasn't worked with one fears the facial recognition thing. Well, it just works. And going home buttonless??? A breeze. After a few days you will stop poking for one and just swipe automatically. I enjoy he extra screen area.",att.com
iphone,1,"I have had a iPhone for the longest I know, this thing just sucks, I have a green line on the side of the screen also the vibration stop working, now it makes a weird noise, it’s more like a short circuit, I have the phone for a week and now this.",att.com
iphone,1,"THIS IS THE WORST PHONE IVE EVER OWNED! it’s slow, never loads anything, freezes up, doesn’t register when I press buttons I hate it beyond words.",att.com
iphone,5,"The FaceID works great and gets better as more apps support it. The size is an improvement over the 6 Plus, with bigger screen on smaller phone. The processor is so fast I had to adjust my gameplay on Angry Birds. Can't rate the camera (so I hope it doesn't give it 0 stars) because I have not taken a picture but did play with the optical zoom and it is very good.",att.com
iphone,2,"I don't really like the IPhone X. If I wanted an Android, I would have bought one. I wish I would have kept my 7+. It is not user friend, I hate freaking swiping. Bring back the fingerprint recognition. Most offices do not allow cameras.",att.com
iphone,1,"I’m so disappointed, I get this phone with more capacity and it’s freezing most of the time. And when I’m in WhatsApp application all the time is trying make connections, the same with safari. Should I go to att store to returned and change it for something good at least? Thanks",att.com
iphone,2,"This is by far the best IPhone so far. I love everything about it, it is so smooth and so awesome to use! I am so happy that I have this phone and I recommend anyone that is deciding between the IPhone 8 and the IPhone X to get this phone! Actually, I recommend android users to switch to this phone, it is much better!! Oh and the speed is AMAZING, so fast!",att.com
iphone,5,"The iPhone X is overall beautifully designed, excellent camera, Face ID is kool, intuitivemy brilliant without the home button!",att.com
iphone,5,Apple continues to make this product even easier to use. The facial recognition software recognizes me with and without my eyeglasses. No buttons on the front make for easier navigation with gestures only. This version is the best yet. ATT made it easy to exchange my iPhone 7 using the same box that the iPhone X arrived in and a prepaid parcel post label.,att.com
iphone,5,"The iPhone 10 is great, I like the camera editing effects, I like the size because it can still fit in my pocket. The one detail that they did change that is inconvenient is the ear phones. It went from the AC adapter to the normal iPhone charger connection so you can't charge and listen to music at the same time. Otherwise, I'm enjoying the upgrade.",att.com
iphone,5,"When I first set eye on the iPhone X I knew it would be my next purchase that would be amazing! Hands down love everything about the device and most importantly the battery life. I’m always on my device rather it’s to check blogs, stocks or even creating documents on the go and knowing that I can in entire day with a good 45% left is really incredible!",att.com
iphone,5,"I think this is a really good phone. It took some adjustment to my habits, but I am glad I made the switch from the iPhone 7. Face ID works every time and is MUCH faster than Touch ID. New features like the camera and the hard-press keyboard functions are great. Screen is much bigger, so one-handed operation is harder but I never did that much anyway.",att.com
iphone,5,The iPhone X is a at least 2 steps up from the iPhone 7 I exchanged for it. Facial recognition simplifies opening the phone and the gesture driven functions of the phone are extremely easy to master. The edge to edge display enhances all interactions with the phone's apps and utilities. The enhanced camera is an added bonus. Couldn't be happier.,att.com
iphone,2,"Horrible phone! Taking a picture is a nightmare, holding two buttons to snap a picture... who designed this?",att.com
iphone,5,This is the best by far Apple has done in a while. Other then the durability issue. This is a flat out win,att.com
iphone,4,"Overall I like it. I think what I like the least is the face recognition for unlock. I miss being able to reach across the table and unlock with my finger, now I have to pick it up or bend over it. Just a lot less convenient at times. Some of the swiping features are awkward or at least I’m not use to it yet. Besides that everything else is great.",att.com
iphone,3,"The features are of course a plus but the size and weight killed it for me. Im used to the Plus versions of Iphone and this was like downsizing to a 6, even tho everyone keeps saying the screen is bigger but not the phone returned and just got the 8plus with my upgrade until they release a plus size version of this phone i will stick with my 8plus",att.com
iphone,1,Don’t have time for a lengthy review has a numerous amount of bugs in all the pre installed applications,att.com
iphone,5,I really do enjoy the phone overall. It’s very cool. The only thing when setting up your Face ID is make sure to yawn in case you’re like me and get tired and yawn while using your phone so it’ll unlock then as well!! Mine wouldn’t unlock the first time I set it up cuz I didn’t open my mouth during the setup but the second time it worked great!!,att.com
iphone,5,"Thus far I really enjoy this phone. Having come from an iPhone 5, it is a dramtically noticeable improvement when it comes to usability and speed. My one complaint so far is that I wish tutorials were a little more comprehensive on the phone's technology and capabilities. Felt pretty glossed over in that area. Otherwise a very welcome upgrade.",att.com
iphone,5,"Just like anything, it takes a little getting use to when you’ve had the previous for so long! But now I’m so happy I went X than 8Plus. My ultimate decision was a video review from cNet. Beyond the technology, my big sale point was the screen size! Basically same screen size on a smaller body! So much easier to handle and in your pocket!",att.com
iphone,5,"I started using my iPhone X on November 11 2017 and this is the best cell phone I have ever had. I have had cell phones for over 30 years and from where I started to iPhone X is unbelievable. Out of the box, set it up in about 30 minutes, and the battery life is unbelievable. You will not be disappointed it is everything I expected and more.",att.com
iphone,5,"The facial recognition works great. The sound is much better with this phone too! Of course the big screen display is very nice. Camera is awesome! And the phone is really fast, so when you push a hot link just touch it quickly or it won’t activate...it’s that fast! I feel like this phone is somehow is on a higher level than other iPhones.",att.com
iphone,3,My last iPhone was a six. The X isn’t user friendly. I keep saying maybe I will get use to it. Jus to close out apps is difficult. The face recognition on the apps like my banking apps don’t always work. And the phone overall is slow to respond. I’ve always had and iPhone along with all other apple products but this is isn’t as easy to use.,att.com
iphone,5,"I’ve had the iPhone X for a little over a week. This phone is a workhorse and not much it can’t do! I have to admit I’m impressed.. I thought I would miss the size of my 8 plus but I haven’t because of how fast, smooth and solid the X is. No home button wasn’t a problem either as I quickly adapted to the new interface. Ok Apple - I LOVE it!",att.com
iphone,5,"I went from the 7 Plus to the X and it took a little while to get adjusted to the smaller overall size especially the keyboard. However, the device itself is smooth, the response is excellent and it appears to process data, etc pretty quickly. This phone would be perfect if they made it in the Plus size but overall, I like it alot so far.",att.com
iphone,5,"Beautiful phone. Nice feel to it, good size and overall happy with my purchase.",att.com
iphone,1,"Certainly not the quality one would expect, especially at this price point!",att.com
iphone,1,"Coming from a plus, I feel like I've been sent back to the original.",att.com
iphone,4,"I’m a long time Apple user and upgraded from a 6s to the iPhone X. Only thing I have a bone to pick about is that it won’t connect to my current Bluetooth headphones or my car Bluetooth. I know, first world problems. But why do I have to buy all new accessories or car to get things to work. Maybe a trip to the Apple store would help.",att.com
iphone,5,"I upgraded from the 6s to the X due to the updates ruining my 6s. Although it was unplanned, this was probably the best move.
The X delivers. It’s screen is actually BIGGER than the plus models. Only reason people will refute that is because the plus models include large borders around the phone.
Not once has facial recognition failed for me.
The smoothness of switching between apps is great.
It’s very fast. The camera is by far the best I’ve used on a phone. I’m big on photo editing and touching up photos for marketing purposes, and I feel no need to with this.
As for the price, get with the times people. Prices of phones have increased since the original iPhone era. For what phones can do these days, it’s justifiable. I have owned a MacBook since 2008 until it recently bit the dust and this has taken the place of it. Out of the office since I work in Sales, this does everything I need to do.
I give this a 5/5 on all aspects.",att.com
iphone,5,"Before I bought the IPhone X I read almost every review I could. I saw people complaining about the phone size, the screen size, the durability, and the fact that some apps don’t take up the whole screen. WELL I went from the iPhone 7 Plus and I love the phone being small with the screen being bigger I can still see the same as I did on the 7 pulse but I also don’t have to worry about it not fitting in my hand very well. I’ve already dropped this thing twice and there’s nothing wrong with it at all (I don’t have the glass screen protector and a speck case though. Also most of the apps do fit to my screen perfectly the only one I have seen not is my schools app which makes sense cause they probably aren’t to worried about updating it just for the new phone. I love this phone though very easy to use, really cool features, and the camera is TO DIE FOR. I really like not having a home button, it actually makes it easier and the facial ID works really fast.",att.com
iphone,5,I absolutely love this phone. I couldn’t be any happier with it. I had it originally with a different carrier but ended up having to downgrade to the iPhone 6 and missed my X. Finally got a new one when I switched to AT&T and I can’t tell you how much of a difference it makes. The photos alone are a reason to upgrade to this phone.,att.com
iphone,5,I bought the Apple watch series 3 and the iPhone X on the same day. Both products live up to every inch of their advertisements. I have never owned a phone with so many features and capabilities with such ease of operation. So do yourself a favor and make your life easier..........go get the iphone X. You won't be disappointed!,att.com
iphone,5,"I love this phone, the no home button and face recognition is what makes me so happy with this choice. Even though the sales were low and they are going to discontinue the model did disappoint me, as now my week old iphonex is obsolete... Go Apple, they should give us a trade in value for the new phones coming out this summer. JS",att.com
iphone,3,"Overall pretty good. Nothing extravagant. If you are accustomed to an iPhone plus, I certainly would not recommend. The full screen feature is overrated and pretty much for the home screen and some videos on you tube. If the X came as a plus, I'd certainly get it. I think the advertisement for the full screen effect is misleading.",att.com
iphone,1,The phone is not very user friendly. You have to get online to find out how you can hang up a phone call. The phone is very slow. There are so many issues not enough room to list them.,att.com
iphone,5,This phone is everything I expected it to be. Love it!,att.com
iphone,3,"Tons of features but impossible to share with people that have not equal technology. Impossible to upload on Instagram or FB great videos, too heavy. The camaras are great but when using block itself and I needed to shut down completly the cell and restart to continue using. So, too expensive and it works so-so. Not very happy.",att.com
iphone,5,"So far, this has been my favorite Iphone! It was a little awkward not having the home button, but other than that everything has been awesome! I had a 6SPlus, so the X's screen is smaller, but I actually prefer that. Fits in pockets and purses better! The camera is amazing...just saying! A definite must upgrade kind of deal!",att.com
iphone,1,Not very happy with it or Not wort the money,att.com
iphone,5,"I have a phone that works, More than I can say for the phone that I had before. It was a 6S and it was giving me trouble nonstop. I’m so grateful to have this phone and I really think that it is user-friendly and I like the size. Granted, the price tag was extreme, but since I make my money with my phone it was well worth it.",att.com
iphone,5,My husband and I both got the new iPhone X as a Christmas gift to each other. We both are very active and use them for work. They are fast and love the Face ID log in for access and our apps. Camera is amazing and the features create beautiful picture options. Still learning all the great new features but so glad we got them.,att.com
iphone,4,"I really like the new iPhone X. The functions of the phone are great, the one thing I’m disappointed in is the screen size. It’s not as wide as my iPhone 6s Plus, even thought the screen stretch’s the whole length of the phone everything on the screen is smaller. It’s hard to go backwards. I hope the next phone out is bigger.",att.com
iphone,5,"In the two weeks that I have had phone I have been on other website and Youtube and have found many new, hidden, and unspoken of features the iPhone X has to offer. I excited too see what new and upcoming features I find!! I was afraid of leaving the iPhone 7 plus for a smaller phone but it powerful. Fast and quick charging.",att.com
iphone,5,I switched from android to this phone and I love it. Liked the difference. Not a solid ANDROID HATER By any means. Just wanted something different. I am kinda jealous of the upcoming 9 though for the Android. Honestly may have waited had I known sooner. Facial recognition is sweet on the X. Won’t be disappointed.,att.com
iphone,4,"The iPhong demonstrates facial recognition. I love the capacity of the 256 GB; it provides space and I can utilize it's storage for additional information e.g. movies, files and music. I don't like the idea of swapping just yet, maybe a finger print along with facial recognition is another ideal addition to it's technology.",att.com

iphone,5,I’ve owned the iPhoneX for a couple weeks now and I love it. My last phone was an iPhone 6 Plus.

iphone,5,I really enjoy the new look of the iPhone X. I really enjoy having the facial recognition. I am glad that I went with the iPhone X. I highly recommended this phone for both the young and young at heart. It offers something for everyone. I definitely don’t want to forget about the battery life on this phone-its great.,att.com
iphone,4,I have a Samsung S9+ and I hate to admit it BUT the iPhone X is better than I thought. This phone was a gift. It is smaller than the S9+ but it is packed with many surprises and fast. I’m still not a fan of the notch but I’ll get over it. It may be a little pricey but it’s worth every extra $$. No regrets here!!!,att.com
iphone,5,"After having all of the iphones, Apple did it Right with this one. The Iphone X is wonderful.....great display, easy to use and a great sleek look. There is a little bit of a learning curve, learning the way of using the phone but its very simple, once you get the hang of it. Totally recommend this iPhone!!",att.com
iphone,5,Great features with iOS 11. Beautiful phone. Just the right weight. Beautiful screen. Dual charging options out of the box. Face ID is great; not much slower than touch with finger rest on iPhone 7 Plus. I would buy one for everyone in my family with confidence but I enjoy being slightly cooler than them.,att.com
iphone,5,I’ve been an iPhone fan and user since the first one came out. Each one has been better and stronger and the X has not disappointed.

iphone,5,The phone is amazing. The only thing I don’t like is the way you completely close apps. I like the swipe up method better than the hold down and X out of it.

Thank you Apple! Don’t wait go for it!!",att.com
iphone,5,The latest iPhone is always nice to have. The facial recognition is a major plus. I have working hands. So the finger recognition on the 6s+ was not always adequate. Even with or withought me glasses the facial recognition still recognizes my face. The new camera fetures are a major upgrade as well.,att.com
iphone,5,"It took a couple of days to get used to the lack of a home button and the various swipes to get places, but once I got used to it, it is a very nice phone and intuitively easy. I had also been skeptical of the facial recognition, but that works amazingly well and quickly. All in all, a great phone.",att.com
iphone,1,This is apple worst decision every,att.com
iphone,5,I’ve had it about a month now and am loving every minute of it!! People are just to picky anymore and don’t know how to properly use a phone. The Face ID is lightening fast and so is the processor. Screen is amazingly bright and vibrant as well. Camera is awesome as well! The design is Very sleek!,att.com
iphone,5,I was perfectly happy with my IPhone 6 Plus but after reading numerous rave reviews I made the upgrade. What a fantastic phone! With too many new favorite features than I have room to mention! My absolute favorite is the camera! I film a ton of music shows and the new camera design is heavenly!!!,att.com
iphone,5,The I phone x feels completely like a different phone. I love the facial unlocking. I love the swiping apps. I do love the fact that the button is gone and have fewer steps to open. I love how my life proof case fits the x. The look it has. The screen is larger than bigger phones. I just love it.,att.com
iphone,5,The screen is awesome. Love that it’s the same size screen as the 8s Plus but the phone itself is the size of the 8s. the pictures are super clear and crisp. And i like the new features of no home button and the talking emojis. Lol. So much fun. I hate the hefty price tag but i do love the phone.,att.com
iphone,5,"I’m not a person who goes and buys the latest gadget every time one comes out. Usually I buy an older refurbished model and keep that for years. But since My boyfriend of three years ended things, I decided to do some retail therapy. I’m so glad I did because the new iPhone X rocks! I may never fully learn all the cool things that can be done with it, for instance I need to see what I am doing wrong with saving files on iCloud and accessing them on the phone, but I have done a few animoji texts which are so cool! I’m not a very photogenic person but I will try out the jammin’ camera when I get a chance. I dig the face id aspect and not having to type in user ids or passwords on occasion. Not sure if I am ready to store payment options through Apple pay yet, but it’s nice that it will be there if I ever do. I’m so grateful to AT&T for giving me the extra gbs on my data plan and giving me the otterbox defender case for being a loyal customer. Never knew I was entitled to so many great perks!",att.com
iphone,5,Love this phone. the only thing that an be annoying is having to pick up the phone to unlock it. the fingerscan was easier to use to check your phone quickly. its more difficult to look at your phone discreetly without the fingerscan. overall great product. love all the other new features.,att.com
iphone,5,I bought this iPhone X for myself and it is super great!!!! I upgraded from iPhone 6p and you can really see the difference in speeds. The menus change very quickly and the 4k ultra on the video is fantastic.I like the full screen across the phone as well. You cannot go wrong with this iPhone.,att.com
iphone,5,I thought that the X would be hard to operate because I had become really accustomed to the 6 Plus and didn’t really utilize that device to the full capacity but I am enjoying getting acclimated with the latest technology that Apple has released with the X. It’s definitely a great toy to have.,att.com
iphone,5,If you are looking for a new iphone experience the X is the way to go i know its expensive but i think its worth it,att.com
iphone,5,I love this phone. The size is the perfect balance for someone who loves the bigger look but enjoys the slightly smaller size. The interface is surprising easy to learn adjust to. The camera is an amazing upgrade! I love using all the different features to enhance the photos of my family.,att.com
iphone,5,Didn’t really hear much about the phone but figured I’d enjoy the camera and was interested in the Face ID. After getting the phone number I’m very impressed. A week later I still look for reasons to be on the phone. Only feature that’s I’ve not taken advantage of is the wireless charging.,att.com
iphone,3,I am in love with my iPhone X. There are a few things that will need to be fixed. It gets stuck in the landscape screen. Which makes it unlockable. The operating system freezes often. I don’t think the problem is with the phone. I believe it is a problem with the iOS 11. Fix this please!!!,att.com
iphone,5,"Recently just update to the iPhone X. I say worth the buy so much faster, reliable, battery is a life saver. I do miss the two different ports for headphones and charger though. Having one was unnecessary and a cheap move on Apple really. But other than that it’s a great tech savvy device",att.com
iphone,5,I upgraded from an iPhone 6 to the iPhone X. I love it the camera takes awesome pictures it’s fast and has a great battery life. Apple products are easy to use and the functions are very similar. I have not had the time to explore all the functions yet but the ones I have used are great.,att.com
iphone,5,If u like apple. This is the best there is. But if your a andriod person you will always hate the iPhone.,att.com
iphone,5,I was hesitant to buy this phone because of some bad reviews. I am so happy I did. It is the perfect phone for me. It is small enough for my pocket yet the screen is big. I don’t miss the home key at all. It is sleek and easy to keep clean. And it takes great pictures. I love it.,att.com
iphone,5,"First, the service - it is wonderful. Be it in person at an ATT store or on the phone, the treatment is cheerful, helpful and timely. My plans keep improving with every ""visit. The iPhone X - BEST iPhone yet (and I've had EACH one sine #1 - even the 8 plus). Keep up the great work ATT.",att.com
iphone,5,"It’s really good, screen so crisp it’s paper, so smooth, so fast, somehow faceid so fast, it outplaced my iPad 70%, my previous iPhone forgotten, my laptop 50%. So good it is embarrassing expressing love for a device. No way I am replacing that one for a while, love is forever, right?",att.com
iphone,3,"The phone has much room for improvement. It has locked on my twice. I can be texting and all of a sudden, the screen goes back to the home screen and I have to start over. Closing programs can be a hassle if you don't swipe just right. Sometimes this can take several attempts.",att.com
iphone,4,"After sum bad reviews i was like, people are entitled to there own opinion and i shall say i have grown to love iphone x more and more the picture pixel quality is A-1 and i simply adore the face id just look and BOOM the phone and certain apps open with just a bomb selfie look :)",att.com
iphone,4,Great phone and amazing camera and qualities. However I do not recommend this iPhone for older people or people who aren't exactly tech-savvy. It is hard to use. Especially at first. And im 23 and have had iPhones since I was 14. I love it tho and I'm happy once I got used to it.,att.com
iphone,4,I do enjoy the smaller size with same screen size. My only problem is the face recognition. If I’m in a rush it was much easier putting my thumb on home screen button but there’s no longer one of those gotta get ur face at good angle to open phone. Otherwise everything is great,att.com
iphone,5,"Don't listen to negative reviews! I transitioned from an Android phone to the iPhone X and wish I had done it earlier. The Swipe to Open feature is easy to get used to works quite well. The phone is still new to me, so I am not familiar with all features, but I'm learning.",att.com
iphone,5,"I have had IPhones since the 4. The IPhone X is the most amazing user friendly phone yet. I must admit I had to google some things to use it. The no home button requires some learning, but once you learn it’s even easier to use than any of its predecessors. I love this phone.",att.com
iphone,3,Well the new update on the phone prevents you while using a Bluetooth to read incoming texts. When you prompt the Bluetooth to access your new texts it says you need to unlock your phone this is very annoying and difficult to do while driving I am very disappointed with this,att.com
iphone,5,"Love the iPhone X, Perfect size just wish they had it in gold or rose gold!!",att.com
iphone,5,"I am in love. I was a bit nervous about the face id feature, but its been better than expected. It took a bit of getting used to as I was so stuck on the old Iphone, but once I got the hang everything about the X, I am glad I went for it. If you're considering it, do it!!",att.com
iphone,5,I love this phone. I upgraded from a 6s and I wouldn't go back. It's super simple to navigate and surprisingly easy to get used to no home button. The graphics are amazing and the battery lasts much longer than my last iPhone. I would highly suggest this phone to anyone!,att.com
iphone,5,"Apple, please don’t bring back the home button! I don’t use face recognition or pass codes ( NEVER HAVE!) This phone is smoking fast and very responsive to my touch! One flick up IS SO EASY! I’m looking forward to the X-Plus in the fall! Then it will be a perfect phone!",att.com
iphone,3,"Hhhmmm... After a long, excited wait to finally go in and get it, I’m not as impressed as I expected to be. Coming from a 6s Plus 64gb, I don’t feel like this is an “upgrade”. Pros: smaller, huge storage space, louder speakers Cons: smaller, difficult to get used to the changes in function, can’t stand the function to return to/view previous screen(s), glass housing stresses me out (always feeling like I have to be extra gentle with handling it), battery life feels almost worse if not the same, battery percentage no longer shows on upper right corner (no option to change either), you have to swipe down to see it, and the price tag. As each day goes by, my feeling is the same... that I’ll be returning the phone within my 14-day timeframe. Luckily, I still have my 6s Plus to go back to (whew!). Now that’s a great phone. I’ll give 3 stars because the X is not a bad phone, but it’s also not the best phone - for me (and I’m a huge tech-fanatic). This is one case where the newer isn’t better. But always an Apple fan!",att.com
iphone,5,"I was uncertain about the size at first but this phone is actually easier to use larger. I got it as an upgrade for my fiancé and he's in love with it. Happy the design, amount of storage, it's user friendly. He is constantly on the phone and the battery lasts forever.",att.com
iphone,3,"Awesome phone, but it is not worth the money that the phone cost.",att.com
iphone,4,Despite it being fragile it’s a neat device. I like that I can use the keyboard better than I did on the iPhone 7. I like the camera so far. I’ve owned the device for 3 days now. I’m still getting use to the functions with it lacking a home button but it’s still cool.,att.com
iphone,5,"What can I say about the newest improvement of the iPhone, it’s sleek, fashionable and puts a new spin on the “boring” old iPhone design. It’s nice to be able to explore a different type of cell phone phone without losing support of my current Apple ecosystem!!! 10/10",att.com
iphone,4,I upgraded from an iPhone 6 and it was a longer process backing up the old phone to iCloud and then restoring to the new one. Other than that due to my ignorance of apple products it turned out okay. I'll stick to android for my phone and let her keep her iPhone.,att.com

iphone,1,Over priced unnecessary bells and whistles,att.com
iphone,5,"Great phone. It did not take long to get used to the new hand gestures or Face ID. After a weeks use I would not go back to the old way, much quicker and easier. Small problem with freezing inside of the Directv App. Not sure if it is the phone or the app.",att.com
iphone,5,"This iPhone has won me over times 10, i know you may hear reviews on the camera not being good as the Pixel this and that. All i will say is this iPhone will change tech just like the first one did and btw i love the notch no diff than androids status bar.",att.com
iphone,4,"I don’t like that you have to lift the phone up to your face for it to unlock. When it’s laying flat on a table I miss my fingerprint scanner. Otherwise a great phone. Display, speed, camera are all awesome. Love the size of the phone over the huge pluses.",att.com
iphone,5,"Got this on launch day and honestly can’t believe how much I like it. First, the camera is amazing. That alone is worth the change. Having a screen that is essentially the same size as my 7+ in a phone that fits much better in pocket. Best smartphone yet.",att.com
iphone,5,I was skeptical about using an iPhone without the button and for spending the kind of money I did on this phone. I can say I am very pleasantly surprised and excited to keep using this powerhouse of a phone. Once again Apple outdoes themselves with the X.,att.com
iphone,4,"So far, I would rather have my android back. I like their version of google books better. The IOS won’t let me message on Pinterest. I miss using swipe feature on my keyboard. My emails won’t update in a timely manner (24hrs). FB messenger freezes up.",att.com
iphone,5,I was initially skeptical about this phone compared to the other iPhones or even S8. But I was blown away with the user experience. The facial recognition is unbelievable. S8 boasts of facial and iris recognition but it is just nowhere close to iPhone.,att.com
iphone,5,"I was in the store for another issue. While I was waiting, I played with the iPhone X - WOW! I was smitten and traded my 7plus for the X. Still finding out about all the advantages and features about this phone. Can't praise it enough! GO GET ONE!!!",att.com

iphone,1,AT&T sold me a phone that doesn’t work and gave me the run around. Phone was purchased 3 days ago and I still don’t have a working phone. They promised me a phone the next day and charged my credit card for the shipping. I still don’t have a phone.,att.com
iphone,5,All iPhones should be made this way! No home button and a more intuitive IOS. A nice bright contrast OLED screen to view. A great camera that results in me carrying my DSLR less and less. I upgraded from a 7 plus and it’s a world of difference!,att.com
iphone,5,"The Apple iPhone X is an Amazing device, so many features, so much capability. I was skeptical about using facial recognition at first but now I’m sold. The only negative thing I can say is, there aren’t many AR apps out there, but that’ll change",att.com
iphone,5,What can one say about a beautiful phone? I am a die hard iPhone fan and I have been in the AT&T “next” program for a couple years now and when this phone came along I of course jumped at it! I love the new screen real estate and it’s smaller size overall..( my previous phone was the iPhone 7plus) which was a bit too big! This phone is also faster and has loads of useful features! The only complaint I have is that a few of the hidden features are not explained....for example...if you have the phone in your hand and it rings ...the volume drops really low...almost to the point of being a “whisper”...I thought the phone was defective so I made the AT&T person prepare a new phone for me only to find out that the new phone did the same thing! (If the phone rings while it is NOT in your hand the volume is as loud as you set it! The idea I guess is that you don’t need it blasting in your ear if you already know it’s ringing! Ibfelt that the sales person should have known this instead of making me spend another hour activating a different phone!,att.com
iphone,5,I love this phone! The camera quality is fantastic and it fits perfectly in my small hands! I don’t drop my phone on my face anymore! There are still a few glitchy bugs but that’s with any new device! Great job Apple! It was well worth the price!,att.com

iphone,5,"I am a long time Apple user. However, I have to admit Apple's products have gone down since Steve Job. at least it seems to. I was not going to switch from my iPhone 7Plus to X after I watched the Apple's product launch by Tim Cook. it was just disappointed and nothing much 'wow' factors from the way presented. However.... after using this phone for a few weeks, I realized how advanced and well made, packed with crazy but saddle technologies in this compact iPhone X. iPhone 7 Plus was ok, but hated the size. Learned X's screen size is actually bigger or similar than 7 plus but the size of a phone is smaller. - that is PERFECT. Camera quality with Studio lighting is amazing, they should have presented more clearly how they have achieved another break-through phone. If Steve Job had presented, the product would likely be treated as 'wow- product'. Although some old app developers have not caught up with the new X screen and tech that I won't be able to use them, it is no issue. Very impressed by this phone, especially comparing from the latest Samsung. Highly recommended.",att.com

iphone,5,I’ve only owned the phone for a week and so far so good. The camera on the phone is a big step up from my 6s and there is a very noticeable improvement in battery life.,att.com
iphone,3,My rating is based mostly on value of purchase. There is nothing really new to justify the price in Apples latest version of this phone. Face scratches easier than ever. The camera is OK. Fine for web work but not yet worthy of printing except under limited conditions. This was really disappointing but it is nice to be able to focus more like a camera. For younger users this concept is probably new but for me it’s way overdue and works ok. I prefer the old button interface. IT WORKED BETTER Apple. (even with the loss of screen). The new interface remains so-so after six months of using it. I’m good with it if it improves touch accuracy. The X is far wonkier when it comes to arranging/erasing apps. Forgone conclusion the phone is extremely slippery but of course who doesn’t use a cover these days. There’s nothing wrong with this phone and it has some great qualities but knowing it’s made by slave labor to huge profits without any major improvements the price is simply ridiculous. I regret buying it and have encouraged my daughters to check out Googles phones. Sd (apple guy and cell phone user since the 80’s. ),att.com

iphone,5,"Having owned several smart phones starting with android. I made the move over to the apple ecosystem several years ago starting with the iPhone 5s and have had a few hand sets 6s and se. I love how everything about iPhone just works. There was no looking for alternative apps or tweaking a setting to get things to function. With this phone I already knew it was great looking, but what I’m amazed at is how great and intuitive it really is. The loss of the home button you would think would limit functionality or find yourself missing the center piece of apples iOS hardware ui. This is not the case I find on my other idevices I try to use the touch only interface of the iPhone X. Tap to wake, swipe up to go home, or swipe on the charm bar to seamlessly switch between apps it’s great. Battery life is stellar especially with the stock all black apple wallpaper, thanks to the new oled display. FaceID works quickly and accurately, and I love that notifications on the lock screen are in private mode until I look at them. Just a great user experience and why I rely on the apple eco system of devices.

iphone,3,"I got the X bc I liked the idea of a larger screen on a smaller phone, but I wasn’t sure about facial recognition or losing my home button. Well, facial recognition is absolutely awesome! You don’t even realize it’s unlocking PW protected parts of the phone. The home button took a few days to get used to, but now I can jump from open tabs and apps without thinking. Now the bad. Yes the screen is longer, but it loses width, and width is what’s important when big fingers are typing on these keyboards. Even if it were an infinity screen it would help bc while the display is edge to edge, picture display is not. That little bit we lose around the edges would help a lot. Also, why the cut out at the top? Yet another example of a full screen, but not full display. I’ll have this for a year before trading in for whatever is new, which is good bc I’m not too sure of this. When I’m at home I actually still use my 6+ more than my X, not a good sign for a high price “game changer”. I do like the wireless charging, but I could’ve gotten that on an 8+. Great phone for someone who doesn’t need a wide keyboard but IMO the length to width ratio is off, and it looks like apps and webpages are just stretched to fit.",att.com

iphone,5,"I was looking forward to this upgrade moving up from the iPhone 7, and so far I’m loving it. The lack of a home button does take a bit of getting used to, but it makes using the phone much more seamless especially for apps that utilize the FaceID biometrics where things will unlock just by looking at your screen. Not to mention FaceID will also detect your face even with sunglasses and a hat on! The camera is also a nice upgrade from the previous model coming second to the Google Pixel 2 in overall DxOMARK rating. I’m no photographer but picture quality is superb as always from my experiences with Apple and comparable Android products alike. The past two phones I’ve owned, I’ve put in cases and applied screen protectors as soon as I took them out of the box. Especially because this phone is a slippery glass sandwich, I recommend getting a glass screen protector to retain the screen’s clarity and provide protection in case of an accident (which is easily replaceable in case it does break). As well as a case for all around durability and there are many options available on the market. Overall, the iPhone X is a wonderful product and a decent upgrade over the previous model, otherwise I just paid my rent’s worth for a glass slab.",att.com

iphone,5,"So, First before i start my review i think its important to understand that reviews are not the end all be all of products and services, but they do provide sort of a glimpse into certain aspects of what to expect and potentially look for. All in all its up to the consumer to decide whats best for them and what they like. With that being said, ny personal opinion on the Iphone x is that its great!! I have been an Iphone user for close to 10 years now and haven't had any issues with any of them as i have not had any issues with my 10. I have had my phone for a week now and am really enjoying it. What i appreciate most about apple products is the simplicity of use. Apple really simplifies everything and it makes for the most seamless experience when it comes to their devices. Does it always come out with a new feature first? No there are several other devices that have features that apple doesn't have and features that apple has added that have been around for a while i.e. wireless charging and face recognition. Apple gets killed because it doesnt always come out with something first. Thats not a bad thing to not be first all the time. When they do reveal something its again in a more seamless and strategic way they makes it effortless. if you are looking for a quality phone then the iphone is a solid choice.",att.com
iphone,5,"I upgraded from the iPhone 6, which I was more than comfortable holding. I wasn't really ready for a new phone, but my processor was. It was becoming unsafe and unreliable for me to use...it wouldn't perform as quickly as I needed it to, and wouldn't maneuver fluidly from one operation to the next. I could have gone with the iPhone 8; the size and processor are both comparable with the X. In the 8 the camera lacks portrait mode but (for me) gains with finger print recognition. The X was still a better sell. I'm not a huge fan of the face recognition feature, but I'm hopeful that they may bring back finger print recognition along with face recognition in later iPhone models. The X doesn't always recognize my face, and I don't always unlock my phone while looking at it. It forces me to have to pay attention to it in a way that I don't always want to. I do enjoy the swipe away feature to return to the home screen. Most of the other functions remain the same. The new emoji feature is fun. I needed a phone to work seamlessly and my 6 wasn't cutting it. At the time it was smart for me to invest in a phone that was moving in the direction of Apple's future instead of the 8 which is a healthy reminder of its past. If it is important for your phone to move more quickly and you can afford the additional charge to your phone bill for a couple years, then go with the X. By then you'll own the phone and in another year or two after that be ready for the latest iPhone. Cheers!",att.com
iphone,5,"I admit I was worried that I wouldn’t be totally happy with it coming from an IPhone 6S Plus. I really liked the classic home button and the screen size. I previously had an IPhone 6 and it was a tad smaller than I’d wanted & when I upgraded to th me Plus it took a bit to get used to the size which was borderline too big for everyday pocket carry useage.... and so along comes the IPhone X! being in between the two and with the longer screen than the Plus it’s just what I needed! Size wise if I’m being nit picky it would’ve been nice if it was a tad wider, just a tad, I mean maybe 5/32 or 1/8” of an inch wider and it would’ve been absolutely perfect as far as a little better aspect ratio... With that said though I really like the IPhone X! I like the smoothness and speed, while my 6S Plus I had no complaints with, the X feels pretty similar. I haven’t tried them head to head but they’re both seemless for me in every way. The X does boot up noticeably faster which the 6S Plus was pretty darn fast to begin with. Either way no complaints at all there. Back to the home button thing... a day messing around, getting used to the phone & getting familiar with the gestures, I do not miss the home button in the least bit. We grown to enjoy the IPhone for what it is and Apple managed to modernize and maximize the screen size yet keeping it true to the IPhone we grown to love. The face recognition while not perfect is impressive and you have to use it to appreciate it. It is close to as fast as the fingerprint recognition not quite as reliable especially when it’s is dark or under certain lighting conditions and some apps still have to get bugs worked out regarding this but I’m sure that will improve with updates. It does work 90% of the time for me and really impressively fast at that! Little things like the alarm toning down when you look at the phone and just being able to is it with the phone on your desk etc with your hands “tied” up all you need is a free pinky & looking at your phone be able to easily unlock and use the phone. It does make it very convenient at times and you won’t really realize those certain things until you have and use it for a day or two. Just when you think it couldn’t get easier to use with the home button etc Apple improves the useability! While the X rids of the classic iPhone look it is not missed once you get to enjoy the maximum screen size yet keeping the phone more compact. I also have to reiterate it still feels and operates like an IPhone which for me is a huge positive. The battery life impresses me. It is supposed to have less life than that of the Plus models however not the case for me granted my Plus is a couple years old. Either way I am happy with it, I use my phone quite a bit throughout the day and for work as well & I can go the whole day on a full charge whereas previously maybe 2/3 of the day before needing to charge my 6S Plus. Camera and screen display is just wow. Noticeably crispier and More vibrant colors than my 6S Plus. The Notch.... I admit at first it was a bit irritating blocking that small portion of the screen while watching or playing full screen but for me now does not bother me at all & in rare situations where I need to see where the notch is a simple pinch to bring the screen in squares what away. Yes in that situation some say that now you’re no different than the non Plus size iPhones. In that regard while I can sort of understand I don’t agree with that in whole. It’s almost like saying “I have to stay below 70mph on certain roads in my Lambo Diablo so now it’s no better than a Kia” I mean with all the X has to offer, having to deal with occasionally watching a slightly smaller screen than I was used to on the Plus is for me not a prob at all. When I’m able to utilize the entire screen it’s definitely Impressive and do not miss the Plus at all. In fact I’ve grown to really appreciate the more compact size of the phone. Now my old Plus which is now my daughters feels bulky and heavy! That’s not to say I wouldn’t consider an X Plus if that comes out tho haha! I do fee that I’d they end up making the Phone X “plus” the same size as the 6,7,8 Plus it would probably be too big for my taste however slightly smaller than the 8 Plus and we only can imagine the screen size and it will make it a tough decision but right now I am enjoying my IPhone X! Get a good case to protect your investment, there are a lot of cool cases out there for it. It did impress me tho, a friend dropped his (slid off his lap) with no case out of his Jeep on to the pavement! He got lucky! He doesn’t like cases , to each his own... anyways. Two thumbs up for me!!",att.com
iphone,5,"Where do I start? The ten is here and it lives up to its name. The facial recognition feature is a determined leap forward in iPhone security, as surely as the iPhone 5 was with its (then) revolutionary thumb scanner. The elimination of the home button will take some time to adjust to, but adjust you will. The downside of the upswipe to switch from open apps and windows is that to close them becomes a three step process. First the swipe up to view them all, then the depressing of one to prepare some (or all) to close, then finally depressing the red dot close tabs on the corners of the windows. This is at least one step too long, and something I expect the engineers at Apple to rectify in the future. As for the camera, you get what you pay for (in this case, handsomely) from Apple. And, as always, it is nothing short of the current state of the art. The iPhone X has set a new standard in how to deploy pictorial splendor from your pocket. The photos and videos you will record are absolutely breathtaking. This is quite simply the new bar that all other smart phone cameras will be judged by. The portrait mode is in a class by itself. Also included is an updated Clips app that now boasts some augmented reality for your enjoyment. As one would expect, there will come a time when this current incarnation is revealed to be crude and ancient, but for now, it’s quite satisfying. The screen size, is just large enough to take advantage of the superior camera the ten boasts, but still respectful of the constraints of the pockets most of us will be fishing this device in and out from. While the price is extraordinarily steep, it is a worthy successor to Apple’s rich history in setting the standard in smart phones. The X is here. It is a ten.",att.com
iphone,3,"I’ve been an iPhone user since iPhone 3 and have upgraded at least every two years since. Though I was leery due to the exorbitant cost of the iPhone X, I finally caved and bought one 8 days ago. Despite the two hours of frustration learning new hand motions for various features, I grew to love some of the added functionality, speed, and shiny-happy look. But almost as soon as I first held the iPhone X, I was gravely aware of its “slippery-ness”. There is NO REASON whatsoever this phone needed to be designed with a glass front AND back. You cannot place the iPhone X on a couch next to you without it slipping across any type of material and into the cracks between cushions ... if not onto the floor. For that matter, you can barely hold the iPhone X without it slipping out of your hand, thereby guaranteeing sales for an entire eco-system of case makers either at the Apple Store, cell phone outlet, or online ... all add-on costs that should be “elective”, not “required”. Now here I sit ... with a cracked front screen despite a premium Zagg screen protector because I ordered an expensive folio-styled case for my iPhone X and it hadn’t arrived before the first time the phone decided to launch itself out of my grubby little hands. If there were a way to file a class-action lawsuit against Apple for intentional designed-obsolescence ... or worse yet, money-grabbing downstream sales ... I would be the first to stand in line to initiate or join such a cause. Yes, I’m ultra-pist (intentional mis-spelling). Why? Because I promote Apple from here to Sunday with my almighty buck. I own a new iMac, a MacBook Pro, a one-year-old iPad, and I have a drawerful of old iPhones I use as wifi toys around my house. Apple, I’m mad you’ve made me so sad. ;(",att.com
