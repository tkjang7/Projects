Now I haven’t dropped mine but I did see the test on durability and this phone failed. - Lots of apps don’t use the full screen. - The keyboard is still too small. - Auto correct has a glitch in it, and cannot be used. - Animoji’s freeze or don’t work at times. - sound switching is still an issue - Facial recognition doesn’t work all the time. - Siri still isn’t very smart.

Not to mention this is a slippery device to hold without a case and the stainless steel boarder.

Instead Apple designed new, quirky, cumbersome (to say the least) ways to do the same, except with Horribly Painful user experience. To name a few: - to terminate a running app: * before: double click on Home button, slide app Up to close it - finish in 1 sec * iPhoneX: slide from bottom extremely and carefully and precisely (if not, you get something else!!!) until you get what you want, THEN, press-hold the app for at least 1sec until a f*cking Delete button appears, THEN, touch the Delete button - to see All running apps: this is a similar ordeal. - to use Touch: NONE. This feature NO LONGER exists - to use FaceID to allow App purchase (or other things) * before: just press-hold touch for about 1sec * iPhoneX: must press Power button twice, and REALLY QUICKLY!!! (to avoid turning of screen) - since the button is on the side, this becomes extremely hard to do with just one hand!\\nOverall: I\\'d rather get iPhone7/8/9 Plus. With the iPhoneX, I think they walked 5 steps forward only to go 10 steps sideways - ie, all-in-all, they\\'ve made almost 0 (or Backward!) progress in making the X \"better\".\\nIf you can leave with the serious limitations and loves past iPhones, then this is for YOU.

I had my ringtones on it in a few minutes, and I have made more. Yes, you do have to use ITunes to do that but it really does only take a few minutes.

Measured diagonally, X has a 5.8\" screen versus the 5.5\" of the 8S. But you have to knock part of that off because the \"horns\" are unusable space in your apps. What you end up with is a screen that is slightly taller than the 8S, but also slightly narrower. You have virtually the same amount of screen. Unfortunately, watching video in full screen leaves a section cut-out on the side or the other option is to center the video, giving you a much smaller viewing area with black bars on all four sides than if you were watching the same video on the 8S.\\nThe build of the phone is trumped-up to be \"surgical grade steel\" and \"the hardest glass ever on a phone.\" Watch the drop-tests to see how easily the glass breaks and see how slippery the \"surgical grade steel\" is to hold onto. You will definitely want a case for your handset. Break the back of your phone? Apple will charge you over $500 to repair it!\\nWhile the processors and memory run quite efficiently with IOS (the best feature of an iPhone), IOS itself has become buggier with each iteration. Autocorrect has gone bonkers with IOS 11, autocorrecting words for no apparent reason or changing letters on you.\\nIt\\'s great that Apple has \"gotten with the times\" and offers fast charging and wireless charging. Unfortunately, the charger included in the box isn\\'t a fast charger - there is a separate charge for that. Same goes for the Wireless charging.\\nApple is really pushing AR (augmented reality) as if they invented it. AR has been around for years and is much simpler than VR (virtual reality). You\\'ve probably been using AR for years without even realizing that is what it was. Such as apps like Messenger or Snapchat putting hats on your head or making you puke a rainbow. Or hunting Pokémon where you see the Pokémon in the real world through your camera\\'s viewfinder. Yep, that\\'s AR and it\\'s been around.

Now back to the iPhone X, it is basically an iPhone 7 Plus with the exception of a smaller body, infinity screen, wireless charging, and facial recognition. Let's face it, Apple is late to the game with most of those features. Unfortunately, I am stuck paying $33.34/month for an underwhelming device with an iPhone 7 Plus-like performance. This is just my opinion and it comes down to the price of the hardware and what is available on the market at a lower price point.

It works great! (Makeup, no makeup, glasses on, glasses off, hair up, hair down). It recognizes me and can tell the difference between my daughter and me (we look a lot alike) easily! The phone itself is gorgeous, it’s a shame to cover it up with a case. But it is glass, and I watched all those dropping videos showing how bad they shatter when dropped, so I will definitely use a case. The OLED display is amazing.

Not to mention this is a slippery device to hold without a case and the stainless steel boarder. Most cases for this phone are thicker and wider for more protection since the phone has two large pieces of glass and it’s substatially heavier which means dropping it is going to chip the stainless steel or crack the front and/or the back of the screen.

Don’t see much difference in the picture quality than my I phone 6 S or the battery lasting longer . It has 64 GB of memory which was better than 16 GB on 6 S but I think all phones come with that feature now . No buttons to hold to Access Siri is about the only good feature of this but I don’t use Siri enough offset the other items . Last but not least it is more difficult to get out of programs , you have to swipe up , hold then hold the program until a red minus sign pops up then you can get out . I think I paid a whole lot more for there advertising gimmick of some of the features . Would take my I phone 6s any day over this phone .',\n",

I instantly love it, its small yet its big screen. The weight is light and its easy to hold the phone. However, there is one problem. It freezes!! Sometimes, i called a person and i couldnt hear. I had to turn on speaker to talk. I had to restart the phone to get normal. Sometimes im on web page, its stuck in there. This is the only issue i have. Other than that, this is thr best iphone in iphone generation.',\n",
       " 'Love: - screen almost as big as iPhone8+, but the phone is a bit bigger than iPhone8 - FaceID works really well, and very easy+fast to setup -- much much better than TouchID when it first came out\\nHate: With the removal of the Home button, there goes every feature that relied on it. Instead Apple designed new, quirky, cumbersome (to say the least) ways to do the same, except with Horribly Painful user experience. To name a few: - to terminate a running app: * before: double click on Home button, slide app Up to close it - finish in 1 sec * iPhoneX: slide from bottom extremely and carefully and precisely (if not, you get something else!!!) until you get what you want, THEN, press-hold the app for at least 1sec until a f*cking Delete button appears, THEN, touch the Delete button - to see All running apps: this is a similar ordeal. - to use Touch: NONE. This feature NO LONGER exists - to use FaceID to allow App purchase (or other things) * before: just press-hold touch for about 1sec * iPhoneX: must press Power button twice, and REALLY QUICKLY!!! (to avoid turning of screen) - since the button is on the side, this becomes extremely hard to do with just one hand!\\nOverall: I\\'d rather get iPhone7/8/9 Plus. With the iPhoneX, I think they walked 5 steps forward only to go 10 steps sideways - ie, all-in-all, they\\'ve made almost 0 (or Backward!) progress in making the X \"better\".\\nIf you can leave with the serious limitations and loves past iPhones, then this is for YOU. If you loved iPhone before, stay with the 7/8/9/etc. If you never used iPhone, Do NOT get the X.',\n",

My fingers seem to cramp holding on to this phone. The screen definitely doesn’t seem to be a 5.8 screen that’s for sure. I’m definitely considering returning the X for and 8 plus until they consider a X PLUS!!

It has 64 GB of memory which was better than 16 GB on 6 S but I think all phones come with that feature now . No buttons to hold to Access Siri is about the only good feature of this but I don’t use Siri enough offset the other items . Last but not least it is more difficult to get out of programs , you have to swipe up , hold then hold the program until a red minus sign pops up then you can get out .

Instead Apple designed new, quirky, cumbersome (to say the least) ways to do the same, except with Horribly Painful user experience. To name a few: - to terminate a running app: * before: double click on Home button, slide app Up to close it - finish in 1 sec * iPhoneX: slide from bottom extremely and carefully and precisely (if not, you get something else!!!) until you get what you want, THEN, press-hold the app for at least 1sec until a f*cking Delete button appears, THEN, touch the Delete button - to see All running apps: this is a similar ordeal. - to use Touch: NONE. This feature NO LONGER exists - to use FaceID to allow App purchase (or other things) * before: just press-hold touch for about 1sec * iPhoneX: must press Power button twice, and REALLY QUICKLY!!! (to avoid turning of screen) - since the button is on the side, this becomes extremely hard to do with just one hand!\\nOverall: I\\'d rather get iPhone7/8/9 Plus. With the iPhoneX, I think they walked 5 steps forward only to go 10 steps sideways - ie, all-in-all, they\\'ve made almost 0 (or Backward!) progress in making the X \"better\".\\nIf you can leave with the serious limitations and loves past iPhones, then this is for YOU.

       " \"Bottom line first- I like the iPhone X, I don't love it. My primary negative comment is the screen is not as large as my 6s Plus, no way! The X screen is SLIGHTLY longer but THINNER. The screen configuration results in the keyboard and characters being much smaller requiring anyone with normal sized fingers to turn the phone sideways to type. Most of the screen is not used by webpages and most apps and as a result you still have the border top and bottom. Apple says vendors will adapt, who knows? Face recognition, Apple Pay etc. work great and the processor is the fastest yet. Battery life is not spectacular either. The new gestures take a while to perfect but it is not a big deal to learn. I still prefer the home button to the constant need to swipe up on the new X. Phone is pricey so think twice as bang for the buck may be slightly lacking. All in all, my 6s plus is just as good, just not as fast.\",\n",

This phone is compatible for wireless charging which is so nice for us lazy people. It is bigger than the iphone 8, yet smaller than the plus. It has portrait mode on both front and back cameras, which makes the picture quality amazing. I really thought that not having a home button would bother me, but since i\\'ve had this phone for a while now i don\\'t think i could ever go back to a home button.',\n",

The length of the screen is great when reading articles and beyond texting I seldom have to use two hands.

Also, facial recognition is much more of a big deal than I thought it would be. Just having to look at the camera rather than use a fingerprint is much more convenient. Concerns that I had read about problems with the recognition working at angles or in total darkness turned out to be non-issues. Battery life could be better - a lot better, really - but I'm able to get a full day of heavy use out of it, so it hasn't been that big of an issues for me.

Facial ID is the bomb while screen size is (in my opinion) optimal though smaller than the iPhone 8. I say optimal because at some point in the evolution of smart phones as the screens get progressively larger the device ceases to be a phone and becomes a tablet or mini-laptop. If you want a phone buy an iPhone X. If you want a tablet (or larger) then buy that type device and “enjoy” lugging that around.

I was back at ATT within a week to get another android. Fast forward, I was intrigued by the IPhone 6 plus, so I tried it and again I needed my android so it went back. Now the IPhone X comes on scene, I decided to give it a shot. Mainly because my beloved androids lacked internal memory and 256gb sounded awesome. Yes, I am aware you can install an SD Card but they have locked the card so that it cannot be used for apps. My internal memory on my S7 was full and I had over 100gb on my SD Card that I could only use for pics, vids, and music. Way to go Android, expandable memory my butt. Anyway, back to the IPhone X. I was really concerned about losing my customization options like my widgets and my apps. I have had this phone for a few days now and I can honestly say that I am so happy I gave it a shot. I had my ringtones on it in a few minutes, and I have made more. Yes, you do have to use ITunes to do that but it really does only take a few minutes. I only found one of my apps that was not available on iPhone but I got another that does everything that app did. The Camera's on this phone are amazing and I really love the face ID. I transferred all my music over and after I transferred everything from my S7 over I still have over 200gb of internal memory left. I really do love this IPhone, that is something I was not planning on doing. The phone is gorgeous and I hate covering it with a case but I plan on having this phone for a long time. Good job Apple, and Android...get your game on or a lot of other android users will be saying goodbye.\",\n",

I went back and forth the first week with whether or not I should change to the 8 Plus and now I’m so glad I didn’t!',\n",
       " \"I was a little hesitant on the idea of no home button, however it is easily something that I got used to not having. Pretty much, I feel like the phone is still very similar to the 7-8 models which are great overall in my opinion anyways. I did go from the 7plus to the xphone and it is very small compared to plus for sure and that takes some adjusting to in handling the phone, etc. It's camera quality is also similar to the 7plus but there are added filters and such with the new xphone. I do not feel like I will be disappointed in my upgrade at all !\",\n",

I bought the X despite it having Face ID and no Touch ID, but I quickly fell in love with Face ID! I especially love that Face ID does not show notification previews until I unlock it with my face; I no longer need to place my phone screen down to prevent other people from seeing my texts.\\nThe screen is stunningly beautiful, especially when watching movies or videos. I hated the notch before I bought the phone and thought I’d end up returning it because it would annoy me that much but my fears were unfounded. I don’t really notice the notch much anymore, primarily because it’s above the reading area.\\nI could go on and on about this phone but I’ll stop now :) Great job Apple!\\nP.S.

The new OLED display provides a rich and vibrant viewing experience without emitting overly saturated colors, camera technology is out of this world, speed is completely insane, and the battery life is much better than expected! Sure, the iphone X isn't perfect in every way possible but is indeed a step in a new direction; revolutionary.

I was afraid I would miss the thumbprint for accessing the phone and most of my apps. Truthfully, I don’t. The facial recognition is much better by far.

Measured diagonally, X has a 5.8\" screen versus the 5.5\" of the 8S. But you have to knock part of that off because the \"horns\" are unusable space in your apps. What you end up with is a screen that is slightly taller than the 8S, but also slightly narrower. You have virtually the same amount of screen. Unfortunately, watching video in full screen leaves a section cut-out on the side or the other option is to center the video, giving you a much smaller viewing area with black bars on all four sides than if you were watching the same video on the 8S.\\nThe build of the phone is trumped-up to be \"surgical grade steel\" and \"the hardest glass ever on a phone.\" Watch the drop-tests to see how easily the glass breaks and see how slippery the \"surgical grade steel\" is to hold onto. You will definitely want a case for your handset. Break the back of your phone? Apple will charge you over $500 to repair it!\\nWhile the processors and memory run quite efficiently with IOS (the best feature of an iPhone), IOS itself has become buggier with each iteration. Autocorrect has gone bonkers with IOS 11, autocorrecting words for no apparent reason or changing letters on you.\\nIt\\'s great that Apple has \"gotten with the times\" and offers fast charging and wireless charging. Unfortunately, the charger included in the box isn\\'t a fast charger - there is a separate charge for that. Same goes for the Wireless charging.\\nApple is really pushing AR (augmented reality) as if they invented it. AR has been around for years and is much simpler than VR (virtual reality). You\\'ve probably been using AR for years without even realizing that is what it was. Such as apps like Messenger or Snapchat putting hats on your head or making you puke a rainbow. Or hunting Pokémon where you see the Pokémon in the real world through your camera\\'s viewfinder. Yep, that\\'s AR and it\\'s been around. When Apple lets you strap a VR headset to your face and explore get back to me.\\nAll in all, the phone is a nice next step from Apple and they are finally getting with the times.

The camera is really good, but doesn't feel much different than the camera on the 8. What is very different is not having a home button. One of the biggest reasons I miss it is that you HAVE to pick up your phone to access the home page. You can't just put your finger on the home button to be recognized. You have to pick it up so your facial recognition will work. One other thing that I don't think any of the engineers thought about - SWIPING UP FOR EVERYTHING CAN CAUSE FOREARM FATIGUE! Think about it, pressing a button with your thumb is a lot easier than moving your hole thumb 1 to 2 inches up 1000 times throughout the day. I have had the phone for 2 weeks or so, but I have noticed that on days I've used the phone a lot that my right forearm is tired.\\nAll in all it's a cool phone. But I wish they had left the home button alone.\",\n",

Small screen, no finger print, gps sucks, notifications are annoying you need to go one by one to delete them instead of just slide them I can’t download a lot of apps the system of Apple make the use of the phone slow. I miss the finger print. Many of my old videos I transfer over I can’t watch them because they aren’t iPhone videos. Many of the apps that I like to use before free of charge I’m froze to start paying',\n",

That is something I really appreciated.\\nWhile filling out the survey here it only lists online, store and other. I chose other because I called them and ordered the phone. I say this so you know my issues with the phone aren’t because I bought some knock off from a guy on the internet when you see “other”.\\nGood luck. Consider an 8 or maybe even a 7. Spend the rest of the money on something better! Hope this helps.',\n",

Bottom bar where the four apps are don’t load sometimes and time on the lock screen disappears and I have to restart phone to get it back. That and random other glitches which are expected with a first iteration of a phone aren’t deal breakers. All in all a good phone with a great camera.',\n",

The notch everyone complains about is barely noticeable after the first 2 minutes of use. The camera is awesome and has cool features (4K video). Also, the swiping motions are far more natural than the home button. It’s sad more people aren’t buying this phone and that Apple is rumored to be discontinuing it this summer.',\n",
       " 'I bought the X after having a 6 Plus and have been very happy with it. The size is better, it looks better with glass on the front and the back and the functionality is easy to grasp. One of the aspects I like is the removal of the home button. It used to get fingerprints on it and wouldn’t work so I had to use the passcode which was a pain. Now, I just hold the phone up and it works due to facial recognition. If you are willing to pay the hefty price tag, I highly recommend the iPhone X.',\n",

People say it takes extra steps but they really just made it more simpler for the newer generations which are the ones who are getting phones earlier and have rich parents who can afford phones like this.

The initial adjustment to facial recognition from finger biometrics was pretty quick. Also, I’m surprised at how much more responsive Siri is. I never really used it that often in the past cause well Siri was garbage. I enjoyed the couple weeks I had the X now and hope to enjoy it for the next few years.',\n",
       " 'I like the quality of the phone. It’s clearly better than any other iPhone. I like the bigger screen. The only thing I don’t like is that you have to have to have your face in front of phone to unlock it, which you did not have to do when there was a fingerprint. I also don’t like that you can’t just swipe the windows to close them anymore which is easier than the way you have to do it now. You have to hold it and hit the x on top to close each one. Takes more time. And it’s annoying',\n",
       " 'I like the speed a lot. My old iPhone was really getting slow. I wasn’t sure about face recognition at first, but I’ve warmed up to it. I wish I could store more than one version of myself, because I had to choose between wearing glasses or not wearing them, but that’s not the end of the world. The photo features are pretty cool, too. There’s a bit of a learning curve, just like with any new device, but it does everything that’s important to me, and has a few extra features to boot.',\n",

I just switch from the note 8 and even though I lived the note 8 I had to go back to apple and get the X ive had this phone for a week and I am very impressed with the phone. The Face ID works great even in very low light. It’s worked about 98% of the time which was about the same for me as Touch ID. Of course when it does work just put in the passcode. The phone fits great in my hand. I like how it’s small like the 8 but the screen is BIGGER than the 8 plus even if it doesn’t seem like it. The cameras are amazing as usual and the Animoji feature is so much fun. I did have a slight problem after the 3 day. The screen went black and took 10 mins to turn back on. I was about to return but I realized it needed an update and it’s been working fin ever since. I do think the price of the phone needs to be lower and it was hyped up a little too much but over all I love it. Ppl wanted a change from apple and now they got it.

I also figured it would take time to get used to not having a home button. That seems to not be the case either. I’m really impressed with how it felt natural without it. This iPhone is absolutely gorgeous. The price may be expensive, maybe even too expensive, but I feel that the phone is built very very well. Only issue, being the glass back, but so far I’ve had a couple of drops, thankfully no shatters with a Speck case from Wal-Mart.\\nThe battery sort of dissappoints me sometimes.. Some days, however, I’m very impressed with the battery. It typically depends on my usage. It gets me through the day, more so than my iPhone 7 Plus did.\\nSpeaking of which, I’d picked up my 7 Plus the other day after using this phone for over a week now and it feels like a brick. Lol I like the smaller design, the screen is slightly bigger than the plus and edge to edge display, I really love this phone so far. I would recommend getting one if it is within your budget.',\n",

The length of the screen is great when reading articles and beyond texting I seldom have to use two hands. The experience transports you back to age ten atop your bike ripping down the tallest hill in the neighborhood, well you get The drift.

I was back at ATT within a week to get another android. Fast forward, I was intrigued by the IPhone 6 plus, so I tried it and again I needed my android so it went back. Now the IPhone X comes on scene, I decided to give it a shot. Mainly because my beloved androids lacked internal memory and 256gb sounded awesome. Yes, I am aware you can install an SD Card but they have locked the card so that it cannot be used for apps. My internal memory on my S7 was full and I had over 100gb on my SD Card that I could only use for pics, vids, and music. Way to go Android, expandable memory my butt. Anyway, back to the IPhone X. I was really concerned about losing my customization options like my widgets and my apps. I have had this phone for a few days now and I can honestly say that I am so happy I gave it a shot. I had my ringtones on it in a few minutes, and I have made more. Yes, you do have to use ITunes to do that but it really does only take a few minutes. I only found one of my apps that was not available on iPhone but I got another that does everything that app did. The Camera's on this phone are amazing and I really love the face ID. I transferred all my music over and after I transferred everything from my S7 over I still have over 200gb of internal memory left. I really do love this IPhone, that is something I was not planning on doing. The phone is gorgeous and I hate covering it with a case but I plan on having this phone for a long time.

You will definitely want a case for your handset. Break the back of your phone? Apple will charge you over $500 to repair it!\\nWhile the processors and memory run quite efficiently with IOS (the best feature of an iPhone), IOS itself has become buggier with each iteration.

Unfortunately, the charger included in the box isn\\'t a fast charger - there is a separate charge for that. Same goes for the Wireless charging.\\nApple is really pushing AR (augmented reality) as if they invented it. AR has been around for years and is much simpler than VR (virtual reality).

I have had the phone for 2 weeks or so, but I have noticed that on days I've used the phone a lot that my right forearm is tired.\\nAll in all it's a cool phone. But I wish they had left the home button alone.\",\n",

That is something I really appreciated.\\nWhile filling out the survey here it only lists online, store and other. I chose other because I called them and ordered the phone. I say this so you know my issues with the phone aren’t because I bought some knock off from a guy on the internet when you see “other”.\\nGood luck. Consider an 8 or maybe even a 7.
