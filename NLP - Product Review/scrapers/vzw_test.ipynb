Sure, there are things I miss from Android OS but no matter what phone I would have chose I would have had to make compromises. What the iPhone X got right that impressed me enough to give it a try was the Samsung made OLED display. Coming from an already great display on my previous Galaxy S7 Edge, I would not settle for a typical iPhone with large bezels and a LCD display. This move into the OLED world was the right move for Apple to make. The 5.8in edge-to-edge screen is truly impressive from my few days of use. The Face ID feature works and it works well. I don't think there's any other questions about it. No, it's not quite as fast as the latest generation of Touch ID but the fluidity of the features is what makes it remarkable. The way notifications reveal themselves to you when the devices recognizes that it is nobody else's face but your own is flawless. iPhone X's cameras are impressive. Definitely one of the best out there and any buyers will not be disappointed but I will not dub it THE best smartphone camera out there. The Pixel 2 holds that title in my eyes but iPhone X is a serious contender and does have an edge if you are taking photos from a distance due to it's 2x Zoom Telephoto lens. The build quality is exceptional. I went with the space grey version and the phone looks and feels as premium as it should. It's smooth and has a great weight to it. I'd expect nothing less from Apple in that department. iOS as a whole hasn't been my favorite OS in recent years but this is the phone that made me try it out again and that, in my opinion, means the iPhone X is superb.

I am so very glad I got the X. Don’t get me wrong, the Note 8 is a fantastic device. But there’s an undefinable quality to the iPhone X that is difficult to put into words.

       " \"I just recently purchased my Apple IPhoneX over a week ago, and I am very satisfied with the product! It is the perfect phone for someone who is very tech savvy and isn't afraid of taking time to figure out the new features compared to the previous apple products. I recently had the IPhone 6s, but it was definitely time for an upgrade. I was contemplating between the Samsung Note 8 and the IPhoneX, and I definitely picked the winner! Technology Features: As the week went on, I noticed how useful the IPhoneX has been for me. With the face recognition; it is very easy for anyone to unlock his or her phone, even in the dark! What makes it even more useful is that other apps allows the facial recognition feature as well, so you don't have to remember any passwords as much. Another thing to note; the camera on this phone is AMAZING. This phone would be perfect if you like to take photographs for fun or even if you’re a professional. The picture quality is outstanding, and you can’t even tell that it is a picture. Stability/ Durability of the product: Before getting this phone, I was a little hesitant when I realized that the phone is all glass, but after a week of having it, you would have it figured out that it is not a problem. The second day of having the phone, I went to get out of my car and the phone slid out of my pocket and onto the pavement. Neither a dent, nor a scratch had appeared on my phone! You could say that the phone is very durable, and the all-new glass look makes it look very sleek. I have also happened to notice that when they said the IPhoneX is water resistant, they were not kidding. You could even use the phone in the shower if you wanted! Negatives: One thing that I do not find thrilling about this product is the final price, but thankfully you are able to make monthly payments. Other than the price, I do not see anything wrong with the IPhoneX. As I said before, this phone is all glass, so if you are a clumsy person, this is not the phone for you. Overall: You would like this phone if you are looking for something that is durable, sleek, and perfect for every day-to-day use. I highly recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for an upgrade from their current IPhone, and even some Samsung users if they are looking for something new.\",\n",
       " \"I love that it's all screen. I love the Face ID and how it unlocks everything without needing to put password in anymore. I'm actually liking the gestures and it makes it easier to navigate through my phone and tasks. The camera is by far the best camera ever. I'm really loving the Animoji on the phone and how they follow my face movement. Overall I am very happy with my X.\",\n",
       " 'Overall a really good phone. FaceID works almost flawlessly. The screen is nothing short of amazing. I thought I might struggle a bit with the new gestures and not having a home button, however the new gestures are very easy to pick up on. The phone feels really nice to hold, if you are like me and don’t like the extra bulk that a case usually adds but worry about the risk of not having a case I would recommend the silicone case that Apple makes.']"
